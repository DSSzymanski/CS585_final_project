Thu Nov 30 15:46:39 +0000 2017	the dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another all-time record). if the dems had won the presidential election, the market would be down 50% from these levels and consumer confidence, which is also at an all-time high, would be “low and glum!”

Fri Dec 01 03:30:42 +0000 2017	a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case! no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration.
Fri Dec 01 11:03:35 +0000 2017	the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. build the wall!
Fri Dec 01 11:13:35 +0000 2017	the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon. the schumer/pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections.

Sun Dec 03 02:13:28 +0000 2017	many people in our country are asking what the “justice” department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary, after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 emails? no justice!
Sun Dec 03 02:22:40 +0000 2017	congratulations to abc news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia, russia, russia witch hunt. more networks and “papers” should do the same with their fake news!

Sun Dec 03 13:00:47 +0000 2017	after years of comey, with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation (and more), running the fbi, its reputation is in tatters - worst in history! but fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.
Sun Dec 03 13:15:21 +0000 2017	people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of abc news (he has been suspended), should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
Sun Dec 03 13:36:45 +0000 2017	report: “anti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probe”  now it all starts to make sense!
Mon Dec 04 11:17:05 +0000 2017	democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama. we need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, border wall, military, pro life, v.a., judges 2nd amendment and more. no to jones, a pelosi/schumer puppet!
Mon Dec 04 12:00:08 +0000 2017	putting pelosi/schumer liberal puppet jones into office in alabama would hurt our great republican agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more. look at your 401-k’s since election. highest stock market ever! jobs are roaring back!

Sat Dec 09 13:02:23 +0000 2017	fake news cnn made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. they were caught red handed, just like lonely brian ross at abc news (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”). watch to see if cnn fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?
Sat Dec 09 13:21:24 +0000 2017	cnn’s slogan is cnn, the most trusted name in news. everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the american public. there are many outlets that are far more trusted than fake news cnn. their slogan should be cnn, the least trusted name in news!

Sun Dec 10 21:18:40 +0000 2017	very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the fake news media. they are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on america!
Mon Dec 11 14:17:18 +0000 2017	another false story, this time in the failing nytimes, that i watch 4-8 hours of television a day - wrong!  also, i seldom, if ever, watch cnn or msnbc, both of which i consider fake news. i never watch don lemon, who i once called the “dumbest man on television!” bad reporting.
Tue Dec 12 12:10:58 +0000 2017	despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the democrats have been unable to show any collusion with russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who i don’t know and/or have never met. fake news!
Tue Dec 12 13:03:35 +0000 2017	lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill &amp; crooked-used!
Tue Dec 12 14:09:26 +0000 2017	the people of alabama will do the right thing. doug jones is pro-abortion, weak on crime, military and illegal immigration, bad for gun owners and veterans and against the wall. jones is a pelosi/schumer puppet. roy moore will always vote with us. vote roy moore!

Wed Dec 13 04:08:41 +0000 2017	congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory. the write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. the people of alabama are great, and the republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. it never ends!
Wed Dec 13 11:22:04 +0000 2017	the reason i originally endorsed luther strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election.  i was right! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
Wed Dec 13 13:02:52 +0000 2017	wow, more than 90% of fake news media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. hence my use of social media, the only way to get the truth out. much of mainstream meadia has become a joke! foxandfriends
Wed Dec 13 14:45:48 +0000 2017	if last night’s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate.

Thu Dec 14 20:27:00 +0000 2017	when americans are free to thrive, innovate, &amp; prosper, there is no challenge too great, no task too large, &amp; no goal beyond our reach.   we are a nation of explorers, pioneers, innovators &amp; inventors. we are nation of people who work hard, dream big, &amp; who never, ever give up...

Mon Dec 18 11:23:49 +0000 2017	remember, republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year. the media refuses to mention this. i said gillespie and moore would lose (for very different reasons), and they did. i also predicted  “i” would win. republicans will do well in 2018, very well! foxandfriends

Mon Dec 18 18:41:05 +0000 2017	the train accident that just occurred in dupont, wa shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. seven trillion dollars spent in the middle east while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! not for long!

Tue Dec 19 15:07:01 +0000 2017	a  story in the washingtonpost that i was close to “rescinding” the nomination of justice gorsuch prior to confirmation is fake news. i never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a justice of the u.s. supreme court. the unnamed sources don’t exist!

Wed Dec 20 14:32:51 +0000 2017	the tax cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the fake news is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated dems, and only demean. this is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon. jobs, jobs, jobs!
Wed Dec 20 16:39:04 +0000 2017	i would like to congratulate senatemajldr on having done a fantastic job both strategically &amp; politically on the passing in the senate of the massive tax cut &amp; reform bill. i could have not asked for a better or more talented partner. our team will go onto many more victories!

Thu Dec 21 12:24:22 +0000 2017	the massive tax cuts, which the fake news media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. companies are already making big payments to workers. dems want to raise taxes, hate these big cuts!

Thu Dec 21 18:16:28 +0000 2017	thank you to everyone who joined me at the whitehouse yesterday. together, we are making america great again!  
Fri Dec 22 12:47:51 +0000 2017	our big and very popular tax cut and reform bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. this is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage. merry christmas!
Fri Dec 22 12:50:42 +0000 2017	so true! 
Fri Dec 22 13:05:06 +0000 2017	at some point, and for the good of the country, i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion. infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. after having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the middle east, it is time to start rebuilding our country!
Fri Dec 22 14:17:04 +0000 2017	“the president has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.” thank you charlie kirk of turning points usa. sadly, the fake mainstream media will never talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. we are compiling a long &amp; beautiful list.
Fri Dec 22 15:04:39 +0000 2017	with all my administration has done on legislative approvals (broke harry truman’s record), regulation cutting, judicial appointments, building military, va, tax cuts &amp; reform, record economy/stock market and so much more, i am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
Fri Dec 22 15:07:55 +0000 2017	will be signing the biggest ever tax cut and reform bill in 30 minutes in oval office. will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
Fri Dec 22 16:46:49 +0000 2017	95% of americans will pay less or, at worst, the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). the dems only want to raise your taxes!
Fri Dec 22 18:40:29 +0000 2017	congressman ron desantis is a brilliant young leader, yale and then harvard law, who would make a great governor of florida. he loves our country and is a true fighter!
Fri Dec 22 20:47:15 +0000 2017	the united nations security council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional sanctions on north korea. the world wants peace, not death!
Fri Dec 22 20:47:43 +0000 2017	today, it was my great honor to sign the largest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. full remarks:  
Fri Dec 22 22:11:56 +0000 2017	remember, the most hated part of obamacare is the individual mandate, which is being terminated under our just signed tax cut bill.
Sat Dec 23 20:27:05 +0000 2017	how can fbi deputy director andrew mccabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ james comey, of the phony hillary clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by clinton puppets during investigation?
Sat Dec 23 20:30:06 +0000 2017	fbi deputy director andrew mccabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!
Sat Dec 23 20:32:42 +0000 2017	wow, “fbi lawyer james baker reassigned,” according to foxnews.
Sat Dec 23 22:44:45 +0000 2017	the stock market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. so many things accomplished by the trump administration, perhaps more than any other president in first year. sadly, will never be reported correctly by the fake news media!
Sat Dec 23 22:57:50 +0000 2017	remember, the republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year. in senate, i said roy m would lose in alabama and supported big luther strange - and roy lost. virginia candidate was not a “trumper,” and he lost.  good republican candidates will win big!
Sun Dec 24 12:25:22 +0000 2017	.foxnews-fbi’s andrew mccabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m (clinton puppet), he was using, allegedly, his fbi official email account to promote her campaign. you obviously cannot do this. these were the people who were investigating hillary clinton.”
Sun Dec 24 13:48:11 +0000 2017	the fake news refuses to talk about how big and how strong our base is. they show fake polls just like they report fake news. despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. make america great again!
Sun Dec 24 20:35:26 +0000 2017	the tax cut/reform bill, including massive alaska drilling and the repeal of the highly unpopular individual mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. don’t let the fake news convince you otherwise...and our insider polls are strong!
Mon Dec 25 02:56:19 +0000 2017	people are proud to be saying merry christmas again. i am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. merry christmas!!!!!
Mon Dec 25 03:51:52 +0000 2017	merry christmas!!

Mon Dec 25 23:33:55 +0000 2017	i hope everyone is having a great christmas, then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to make america great again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
Tue Dec 26 11:58:42 +0000 2017	based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate has been terminated as part of our tax cut bill, which essentially repeals (over time) obamacare, the democrats &amp; republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new healthcare plan!
Tue Dec 26 13:24:27 +0000 2017	wow, foxandfrlends  “dossier is bogus. clinton campaign, dnc funded dossier. fbi cannot (after all of this time) verify claims in dossier of russia/trump collusion. fbi tainted.” and they used this crooked hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the trump campaign!
Tue Dec 26 22:17:14 +0000 2017	all signs are that business is looking really good for next year, only to be helped further by our tax cut bill. will be a great year for companies and jobs! stock market is poised for another year of success!

Thu Dec 28 15:24:53 +0000 2017	vanity fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at crooked h. anna wintour, who was all set to be amb to court of st james’s &amp; a big fundraiser for ch, is beside herself in grief &amp; begging for forgiveness!
Thu Dec 28 16:18:20 +0000 2017	retail sales are at record numbers. we’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!
Thu Dec 28 16:24:08 +0000 2017	caught red handed - very disappointed that china is allowing oil to go into north korea. there will never be a friendly solution to the north korea problem if this continues to happen!

Thu Dec 28 23:14:21 +0000 2017	together, we are making america great again!  
Fri Dec 29 00:01:47 +0000 2017	in the east, it could be the coldest new year’s eve on record. perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country, but not other countries, was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against. bundle up!
Fri Dec 29 12:46:23 +0000 2017	while the fake news loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, foxandfriends just showed that my rating on dec. 28, 2017, was approximately the same as president obama on dec. 28, 2009, which was 47%...and this despite massive negative trump coverage &amp; russia hoax!
Fri Dec 29 13:04:09 +0000 2017	why is the united states post office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer? should be charging much more!
Fri Dec 29 13:16:11 +0000 2017	the democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration &amp; ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc. we must protect our country at all cost!
Sat Dec 30 03:42:58 +0000 2017	many reports of peaceful protests by iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption &amp; its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves. the world is watching! iranprotests
Sat Dec 30 19:00:54 +0000 2017	the entire world understands that the good people of iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the united states, that iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most.... 
Sat Dec 30 19:02:53 +0000 2017	oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice. the world is watching! 
Sat Dec 30 21:12:45 +0000 2017	on taxes: “this is the biggest corporate rate cut ever, going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.this is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. every year the obama wh overstated how the economy would grow. now real economics and jobs.” wsj report
Sat Dec 30 22:36:41 +0000 2017	i use social media not because i like to, but because it is the only way to fight a very dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as fake news media. phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. many stories &amp; reports a pure fiction!
Sat Dec 30 22:42:09 +0000 2017	jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the u.s. unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically cut, and it will only get better. much more to come!
Sun Dec 31 04:46:21 +0000 2017	“trump rally: stocks put 2017 in the record books” 
Sun Dec 31 13:03:29 +0000 2017	big protests in iran. the people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. looks like they will not take it any longer. the usa is watching very closely for human rights violations!
Sun Dec 31 13:26:29 +0000 2017	if the dems (crooked hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on election day. now they have a great future - and just beginning! 
Sun Dec 31 13:36:32 +0000 2017	why would smart voters want to put democrats in congress in 2018 election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the election. people are much better off now not to mention isis, va, judges, strong border, 2nd a, tax cuts &amp; more?
Sun Dec 31 18:36:28 +0000 2017	my deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in douglas county dcsheriff, and their families. we love our police and law enforcement - god bless them all! lesm

Sun Dec 31 22:00:21 +0000 2017	iran, the number one state of sponsored terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. not good!
Sun Dec 31 22:18:20 +0000 2017	as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, i want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest fake news media, a happy and healthy new year. 2018 will be a great year for america!

Wed Jan 10 00:16:57 +0000 2018	as i made very clear today, our country needs the security of the wall on the southern border, which must be part of any daca approval.
Wed Jan 10 03:48:26 +0000 2018	thank you gopleader kevin mccarthy! couldn’t agree w/you more. together, we are maga 
Wed Jan 10 04:23:58 +0000 2018	.icegov hsi agents and ero officers, on behalf of an entire nation, thank you for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow american’s safe. everyone is so grateful! lawenforcementappreciationday president realdonaldtrump 
Wed Jan 10 14:11:13 +0000 2018	it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case (such as daca) always runs to the 9th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
Wed Jan 10 15:00:29 +0000 2018	the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trump/russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. must have tough primary!
Wed Jan 10 15:14:15 +0000 2018	the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues. there was no collusion, everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion, &amp; yet on and on it goes. russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. republicans should finally take control!
Wed Jan 10 20:08:37 +0000 2018	i want to thank my cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. together, we are delivering results and making america great again!

Wed Jan 10 23:07:48 +0000 2018	the united states needs the security of the wall on the southern border, which must be part of any daca approval. the safety and security of our country is 1! 
Wed Jan 10 23:37:41 +0000 2018	cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes america the place to invest! great news as toyota and mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 jobs and investing $1.6 billion in alabama, helping to further grow our economy! 
Thu Jan 11 04:29:02 +0000 2018	good news: toyota and mazda announce giant new huntsville, alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and suv’s a year and employ 4000 people. companies are coming back to the u.s. in a very big way. congratulations alabama!
Thu Jan 11 11:33:06 +0000 2018	disproven and paid for by democrats “dossier used to spy on trump campaign. did fbi use intel tool to influence the election?” foxandfriends  did dems or clinton also pay russians? where are hidden and smashed dnc servers? where are crooked hillary emails?  what a mess!
Thu Jan 11 11:43:59 +0000 2018	in new quinnipiac poll, 66% of people feel the economy is “excellent or good.” that is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
Thu Jan 11 12:33:21 +0000 2018	“house votes on controversial fisa act today.” this is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the trump campaign by the previous administration and others?
Thu Jan 11 13:11:46 +0000 2018	“45 year low in illegal immigration this year.” foxandfriends
Thu Jan 11 14:14:51 +0000 2018	with that being said, i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. we need it! get smart!
Thu Jan 11 15:37:54 +0000 2018	great news, as a result of our tax cuts &amp; jobs act! 
Thu Jan 11 23:27:03 +0000 2018	yesterday, i signed the interdictact (h.r. 2142) with bipartisan members of congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country. together, we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the united states!

Fri Jan 12 02:47:17 +0000 2018	small business poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. all business is just at the beginning of something really special!
Fri Jan 12 02:49:56 +0000 2018	more great news as a result of historical tax cuts and reform: fiat chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 billion in michigan plant, relocating their heavy-truck production from mexico to michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to u.s. employees! 
Fri Jan 12 02:53:05 +0000 2018	chrysler is moving a massive plant from mexico to michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend. thank you chrysler, a very wise decision. the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trump/pence. plenty of more to follow!
Fri Jan 12 03:01:20 +0000 2018	democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
Fri Jan 12 04:42:25 +0000 2018	the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border, risking thousands of lives in the process. it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans. we must build a great wall, think merit and end lottery &amp; chain. usa!
Fri Jan 12 04:57:57 +0000 2018	reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. bad deal. wanted me to cut ribbon-no!
Fri Jan 12 11:59:02 +0000 2018	the so-called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards. wall was not properly funded, chain &amp; lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.....
Fri Jan 12 12:09:58 +0000 2018	....countries which are doing badly. i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. i want safety and security for our people. i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. i want to fund our military, not do a dem defund....
Fri Jan 12 12:20:32 +0000 2018	....because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety, daca has now taken a big step backwards. the dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. get smart, make america great again!
Fri Jan 12 12:28:58 +0000 2018	the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for daca!
Fri Jan 12 12:50:00 +0000 2018	sadly, democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for daca. take care of our military, and our country, first!
Fri Jan 12 13:48:49 +0000 2018	never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. never said “take them out.” made up by dems. i have a wonderful relationship with haitians. probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!
Fri Jan 12 17:56:18 +0000 2018	today, it was my great honor to proclaim january 15, 2018, as martin luther king jr., federal holiday. i encourage all americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of dr. king's life and legacy. 
Sat Jan 13 13:13:12 +0000 2018	yesterday was a big day for the stock market. jobs are coming back to america. chrysler is coming back to the usa, from mexico and many others will follow. tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. american business is hot again!
Sat Jan 13 13:14:03 +0000 2018	the democrats are all talk and no action. they are doing nothing to fix daca. great opportunity missed. too bad!
Sat Jan 13 13:14:20 +0000 2018	america first!
Sat Jan 13 14:20:00 +0000 2018	yesterday was another big day for jobs and the stock market. chrysler coming back to u.s. (michigan) from mexico and many more companies paying out tax cut money to employees. if dems won in november, market would have tanked! it was headed for disaster.
Sat Jan 13 14:20:01 +0000 2018	i don’t believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca. they are all talk and no action. this is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. too bad!
Sat Jan 13 22:08:34 +0000 2018	so much fake news is being reported. they don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election!
Sun Jan 14 12:58:43 +0000 2018	the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them “i have a good relationship with kim jong un” (of n. korea). obviously i didn’t say that. i said “i’d have a good relationship with kim jong un,” a big difference. fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...
Sun Jan 14 13:01:44 +0000 2018	...and they knew exactly what i said and meant. they just wanted a story. fake news!
Sun Jan 14 13:09:09 +0000 2018	daca is probably dead because the democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military.
Sun Jan 14 13:19:06 +0000 2018	i, as president, want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on merit. no more lotteries! america first
Sun Jan 14 13:50:14 +0000 2018	“president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. tax cut bonuses to more than 2,000,000 workers. most explosive stock market rally that we’ve seen in modern times. 18,000 to 26,000 from election, and grounded in profitability and growth. all trump, not 0...
Sun Jan 14 13:59:35 +0000 2018	...big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things). “president trump reversed the policies of president obama, and reversed our economic decline.” thank you stuart varney.  foxandfriends
Mon Jan 15 12:57:43 +0000 2018	statement by me last night in florida: “honestly, i don’t think the democrats want to make a deal. they talk about daca, but they don’t want to help..we are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to. they don’t want security at the border, they don’t want.....
Mon Jan 15 13:02:22 +0000 2018	...to stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.” my standard is very simple, america first &amp; make america great again!
Mon Jan 15 20:28:15 +0000 2018	senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting. deals can’t get made when there is no trust! durbin blew daca and is hurting our military.
Tue Jan 16 13:54:02 +0000 2018	we must have security at our very dangerous southern border, and we must have a great wall to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
Tue Jan 16 14:07:38 +0000 2018	the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security. the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military, at a time we need it more than ever. we need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! no more dangerous lottery.
Tue Jan 16 14:19:46 +0000 2018	do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. the russian collusion hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the dems. public gets it!
Tue Jan 16 14:24:40 +0000 2018	“90% of trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived!foxandfriends

Wed Jan 17 23:28:30 +0000 2018	i promised that my policies would allow companies like apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the united states. great to see apple follow through as a result of tax cuts. huge win for american workers and the usa!

Thu Jan 18 11:15:25 +0000 2018	the wall is the wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it. parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.....
Thu Jan 18 11:25:03 +0000 2018	....the wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the u.s. the $20 billion dollar wall is “peanuts” compared to what mexico makes from the u.s. nafta is a bad joke!

Thu Jan 18 13:37:24 +0000 2018	chip should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 day, or short term, extension!
Thu Jan 18 13:49:11 +0000 2018	a government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the dems care very little about!

Sat Jan 20 02:28:56 +0000 2018	not looking good for our great military or safety &amp; security on the very dangerous southern border. dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.
Sat Jan 20 11:17:10 +0000 2018	democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border. they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead. weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through mess!

Sun Jan 21 12:35:28 +0000 2018	great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border. the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. if stalemate continues, republicans should go to 51% (nuclear option) and vote on real, long term budget, no c.r.’s!

Sat Feb 03 14:40:23 +0000 2018	rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than i had in winning the election, and higher than certain “sacred cows.” other trump polls are way up also. so why does the media refuse to write this? oh well, someday!
Sat Feb 03 14:40:27 +0000 2018	this memo totally vindicates “trump” in probe. but the russian witch hunt goes on and on. their was no collusion and there was no obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing, collusion is dead). this is an american disgrace!
Sun Feb 04 00:26:23 +0000 2018	great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. only russia, russia, russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is no collusion!
Sun Feb 04 00:40:24 +0000 2018	“the four page memo released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....the fbi failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the fbi became....

Mon Feb 05 12:11:56 +0000 2018	the democrats are pushing for universal healthcare while thousands of people are marching in the uk because their u system is going broke and not working. dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. no thanks!
Mon Feb 05 12:17:57 +0000 2018	thank you to foxandfriends for exposing the truth. perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!
Mon Feb 05 12:39:10 +0000 2018	little adam schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in washington, right up there with comey, warner, brennan and clapper! adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. must be stopped!
Mon Feb 05 14:36:40 +0000 2018	any deal on daca that does not include strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a total waste of time. march 5th is rapidly approaching and the dems seem not to care about daca. make a deal!

Tue Feb 06 13:32:57 +0000 2018	so disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed colts linebacker edwin jackson. this is just one of many such preventable tragedies. we must get the dems to get tough on the border, and with illegal immigration, fast!
Tue Feb 06 13:37:00 +0000 2018	my prayers and best wishes are with the family of edwin jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. colts
Tue Feb 06 16:00:43 +0000 2018	polling shows nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca, fully secures the border, ends chain migration &amp; cancels the visa lottery. if d’s oppose this deal, they aren’t serious about daca-they just want open borders. 
Tue Feb 06 16:05:42 +0000 2018	we need a 21st century merit-based immigration system.  chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. 
Tue Feb 06 22:45:50 +0000 2018	today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of ms-13, and the reforms we need from congress to defeat it. watch here:

Fri Feb 09 03:22:53 +0000 2018	wow! -senator mark warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a russian oligarch. warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in london) he requested with steele of fraudulent dossier fame. all tied into crooked hillary.
Fri Feb 09 13:39:15 +0000 2018	just signed bill. our military will now be stronger than ever before. we love and need our military and gave them everything — and more. first time this has happened in a long time. also means jobs, jobs, jobs!
Fri Feb 09 13:47:28 +0000 2018	without more republicans in congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our military. sadly, we needed some dem votes for passage. must elect more republicans in 2018 election!
Fri Feb 09 13:59:13 +0000 2018	costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election, and beyond. this bill is a big victory for our military, but much waste in order to get dem votes. fortunately, daca not included in this bill, negotiations to start now!
Sat Feb 10 14:02:54 +0000 2018	jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!
Sat Feb 10 14:20:35 +0000 2018	the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency. told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
Sat Feb 10 15:20:05 +0000 2018	according to the nytimes, a russian sold phony secrets on “trump” to the u.s. asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. i hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. it is all now starting to come out - drain the swamp!
Sat Feb 10 15:33:35 +0000 2018	peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. some are true and some are false. some are old and some are new. there is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. is there no such thing any longer as due process?
Sat Feb 10 18:16:20 +0000 2018	“my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton/dnc dossier, it shows that he’s been victimized. he’s been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of.......
Sat Feb 10 18:34:49 +0000 2018	....agencies, not just the fbi &amp; doj, now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election. comey had conversations with donald trump, which i don’t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” tom fitton of judicial watch on foxnews
Sat Feb 10 18:50:02 +0000 2018	republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do. the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about daca. they only want to use it as a campaign issue. vote republican!
Sat Feb 10 21:18:23 +0000 2018	my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the westervillepd. 
Sat Feb 10 23:34:08 +0000 2018	my administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans. 
Sun Feb 11 18:21:48 +0000 2018	so many positive things going on for the u.s.a. and the fake news media just doesn’t want to go there. same negative stories over and over again! no wonder the people no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    maga

Tue Feb 13 10:43:22 +0000 2018	our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the democrats. after many years we have taken care of our military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. bipartisan, make deal dems?
Tue Feb 13 10:52:47 +0000 2018	negotiations on daca have begun. republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal. wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the daca puzzle. this will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! march 5th.

Wed Feb 14 20:55:01 +0000 2018	just spoke to governor rick scott. we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting.
Thu Feb 15 12:12:41 +0000 2018	so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!
Thu Feb 15 14:57:21 +0000 2018	while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca, they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa!
Thu Feb 15 17:33:41 +0000 2018	in times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.  
Thu Feb 15 19:25:23 +0000 2018	the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. dhsgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in america.” it creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn’t build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa...
Thu Feb 15 19:26:09 +0000 2018	...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants. voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement, and a vote for open borders. if dems are actually serious about daca, they should support the grassley bill!
Thu Feb 15 20:19:11 +0000 2018	presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland, florida:  
Fri Feb 16 14:37:56 +0000 2018	i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. am also working with congress on many fronts.
Fri Feb 16 14:49:54 +0000 2018	cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democrats...totally abandoned! republicans are still working hard.
Fri Feb 16 20:18:11 +0000 2018	russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014, long before i announced that i would run for president. the results of the election were not impacted. the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
Sat Feb 17 04:53:13 +0000 2018	our entire nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims &amp; their families in parkland, fl. to teachers, law enforcement, first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: we thank you for your courage!  
Sat Feb 17 19:04:43 +0000 2018	melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county, florida. will never forget them, or the evening!
Sat Feb 17 19:26:13 +0000 2018	“charges deal don a big win,” written by michael goodwin of the nypost, succinctly states that “the russians had no impact on the election results.” there was no collusion with the trump campaign. “she lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. case closed.”
Sat Feb 17 19:36:14 +0000 2018	deputy a.g. rod rosenstein stated at the news conference: “there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
Sat Feb 17 19:46:48 +0000 2018	funny how the fake news media doesn’t want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for president. maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn’t know!
Sat Feb 17 20:11:32 +0000 2018	the fake news media never fails. hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads, rob goldman! 
Sat Feb 17 20:16:39 +0000 2018	“i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goal.” rob goldman vice president of facebook ads 
Sat Feb 17 23:45:28 +0000 2018	just like they don’t want to solve the daca problem, why didn’t the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house &amp; senate during the obama administration. because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!
Sun Feb 18 04:08:45 +0000 2018	very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter. this is not acceptable. they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion. get back to the basics and make us all proud!
Sun Feb 18 04:22:48 +0000 2018	general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h, the dnc and the dems. remember the dirty dossier, uranium, speeches, emails and the podesta company!
Sun Feb 18 12:02:52 +0000 2018	never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $1.7 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress, the fbi or justice called for an investigation!
Sun Feb 18 12:22:29 +0000 2018	finally, liddle’ adam schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election. he is finally right about something. obama was president, knew of the threat, and did nothing. thank you adam!
Sun Feb 18 12:33:16 +0000 2018	i never said russia did not meddle in the election, i said “it may be russia, or china or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” the russian “hoax” was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!
Sun Feb 18 12:43:48 +0000 2018	now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats, lead by their fearless leader, crooked hillary clinton, lost the 2016 election. but wasn’t i a great candidate?
Sun Feb 18 13:11:28 +0000 2018	if it was the goal of russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the u.s. then, with all of the committee hearings, investigations and party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. they are laughing their asses off in moscow. get smart america!
Sun Feb 18 13:46:39 +0000 2018	the fake news of big ratings loser cnn. 
Sun Feb 18 13:55:55 +0000 2018	great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot. big gain over last 4 weeks. i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans, the cuts the dems want to take away. we need more republicans!

Mon Feb 19 04:28:40 +0000 2018	just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey, who at one point i knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 minutes. the questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!
Mon Feb 19 13:42:10 +0000 2018	have a great, but very reflective, president’s day!
Mon Feb 19 19:55:49 +0000 2018	obama was president up to, and beyond, the 2016 election. so why didn’t he do something about russian meddling?
Tue Feb 20 02:21:08 +0000 2018	.mittromney has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah. he will make a great senator and worthy successor to orrinhatch, and has my full support and endorsement!
Tue Feb 20 02:29:29 +0000 2018	the u.s. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. the unemployment numbers are looking great, and regulations &amp; taxes have been massively cut! jobs, jobs, jobs

Tue Feb 20 12:24:54 +0000 2018	thank you to foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia, including crimea, syria and so much more. we are now starting to win again!
Tue Feb 20 12:37:20 +0000 2018	“there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so i’d invite mr. trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” .....
Tue Feb 20 12:46:18 +0000 2018	....the president obama quote just before election. that’s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” when i easily won the electoral college, the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems.
Tue Feb 20 12:54:39 +0000 2018	republicans are now leading the generic poll, perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away. actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. also, they want to do nothing on daca, r’s want to fix!
Tue Feb 20 13:03:53 +0000 2018	matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event. big difference from those days when president obama held the white house. you’ve come a long way matt!
Tue Feb 20 13:11:58 +0000 2018	hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” congressional map, all the way to the supreme court, if necessary. your original was correct! don’t let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!
Tue Feb 20 13:38:49 +0000 2018	i have been much tougher on russia than obama, just look at the facts. total fake news!
Tue Feb 20 15:16:06 +0000 2018	a woman i don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago. never happened! who would do this in a public space with live security......
Tue Feb 20 15:29:07 +0000 2018	....cameras running. another false accusation. why doesn’t washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? one had her home mortgage paid off. only foxnews so reported...doesn’t fit the mainstream media narrative.
Tue Feb 20 17:49:07 +0000 2018	main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law. "this shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses." 
Wed Feb 21 01:08:00 +0000 2018	bad ratings cnn &amp; msnbc got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall. they probably knew it was fake news but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!
Wed Feb 21 01:14:19 +0000 2018	so true, thank you! 
Wed Feb 21 01:18:36 +0000 2018	cnn msnbc whether we are republican or democrat, we must now focus on strengthening background checks!
Wed Feb 21 14:03:32 +0000 2018	question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration, right up to january 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff session!
Wed Feb 21 14:22:07 +0000 2018	the great billy graham is dead. there was nobody like him! he will be missed by christians and all religions. a very special man.

Thu Feb 22 12:26:28 +0000 2018	i never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on fake news cnn &amp; nbc. what i said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to
Thu Feb 22 12:40:08 +0000 2018	....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. far more assets at much less cost than guards. a “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. attacks would end!
Thu Feb 22 12:54:09 +0000 2018	....history shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. it takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. great deterrent!
Thu Feb 22 13:05:18 +0000 2018	....if a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will never attack that school. cowards won’t go there...problem solved. must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!

Tue Apr 03 10:49:07 +0000 2018	the big caravan of people from honduras, now coming across mexico and heading to our “weak laws” border, had better be stopped before it gets there. cash cow nafta is in play, as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. congress must act now!
Tue Apr 03 10:58:30 +0000 2018	check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged cnn unless you state that you are totally anti-trump? little jeff zuker, whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately. they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting!
Tue Apr 03 11:08:51 +0000 2018	thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling. just hit 50%, which is higher than cheatin’ obama at the same time in his administration.
Tue Apr 03 13:55:37 +0000 2018	i am right about amazon costing the united states post office massive amounts of money for being their delivery boy. amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the american taxpayer. many billions of dollars. p.o. leaders don’t have a clue (or do they?)!
Tue Apr 03 19:15:42 +0000 2018	today, it was my honor to welcome estonia president kerstikaljulaid, lithuania president grybauskaite_lt, and latvia president vejonis to the whitehouse. congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence! balticsummit:  
Tue Apr 03 19:59:40 +0000 2018	we will protect our southern border! 
Tue Apr 03 21:49:14 +0000 2018	was just briefed on the shooting at youtube’s hq in san bruno, california. our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. thank you to our phenomenal law enforcement officers and first responders that are currently on the scene.
Wed Apr 04 11:19:28 +0000 2018	our border laws are very weak while those of mexico &amp; canada are very strong. congress must change these obama era, and other, laws now! the democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....crime! we will be taking strong action today.
Wed Apr 04 11:22:03 +0000 2018	we are not in a trade war with china, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the u.s. now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year, with intellectual property theft of another $300 billion. we cannot let this continue!
Wed Apr 04 13:20:31 +0000 2018	when you’re already $500 billion down, you can’t lose!
Wed Apr 04 14:50:03 +0000 2018	our thoughts and prayers are with the four u.s. marines from the 3rd marine aircraft wing who lost their lives in yesterday’s southern california helicopter crash. we pray for their families, and our great usmc.
Wed Apr 04 15:05:38 +0000 2018	today we honor dr. martin luther king, jr. on the 50th anniversary of his assassination. earlier this year i spoke about dr. king’s legacy of justice and peace, and his impact on uniting americans. mlk50 proclamation:  
Wed Apr 04 23:08:19 +0000 2018	“still rising: rasmussen poll shows donald trump approval ratings now at 51 percent” 
Thu Apr 05 11:40:53 +0000 2018	the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border. because of the trump administrations actions, border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low. stop drugs!
Thu Apr 05 13:10:07 +0000 2018	the fake news washington post, amazon’s “chief lobbyist,” has another (of many) phony headlines, “trump defiant as china adds trade penalties.” wrong! should read, “trump defiant as u.s. adds trade penalties, will end barriers and massive  i.p. theft.” typically bad reporting!
Thu Apr 05 20:12:10 +0000 2018	thanks to our historic tax cuts, america is open for business, and millions of american workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages, salaries and bonuses! 
Thu Apr 05 20:28:44 +0000 2018	thank you wvgovernor jim justice. it was my great honor to be with the amazing people of west virginia today! maga 
Fri Apr 06 11:11:51 +0000 2018	despite the aluminum tariffs, aluminum prices are down 4%. people are surprised, i’m not! lots of money coming into u.s. coffers and jobs, jobs, jobs!
Fri Apr 06 14:32:43 +0000 2018	china, which is a great economic power, is considered a developing nation within the world trade organization. they therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the u.s. does anybody think this is fair. we were badly represented. the wto is unfair to u.s.
Fri Apr 06 14:46:10 +0000 2018	do you believe that the fake news media is pushing hard on a story that i am going to replace a.g. jeff sessions with epa chief scott pruitt, who is doing a great job but is totally under siege? do people really believe this stuff? so much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!
Fri Apr 06 16:24:27 +0000 2018	america is open for business! 
Fri Apr 06 20:23:58 +0000 2018	“bet founder: trump's economy is bringing black workers back into the labor force” 
Fri Apr 06 20:26:53 +0000 2018	congratulations to bernieandsid on their new 77wabcradio morning radio show in new york city. it was an honor to join you two – good luck! 
Sat Apr 07 17:35:28 +0000 2018	just spoke to justintrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible humboldt team tragedy. may god be with them all!
Sat Apr 07 18:03:56 +0000 2018	the united states hasn’t had a trade surplus with china in 40 years. they must end unfair trade, take down barriers and charge only reciprocal tariffs. the u.s. is losing $500 billion a year, and has been losing billions of dollars for decades. cannot continue!
Sat Apr 07 18:11:15 +0000 2018	we are sealing up our southern border. the people of our great country want safety and security. the dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!
Sat Apr 07 20:52:58 +0000 2018	lawmakers of the house judiciary committee are angrily accusing the department of justice of missing the thursday deadline for turning over unredacted documents relating to fisa abuse, fbi, comey, lynch, mccabe, clinton emails and much more. slow walking - what is going on? bad!
Sat Apr 07 21:00:39 +0000 2018	what does the department of justice and fbi have to hide? why aren’t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the house judiciary committee? stalling, but for what reason? not looking good!
Sat Apr 07 22:42:22 +0000 2018	fire at trump tower is out. very confined (well built building). firemen (and women) did a great job. thank you!
Sun Apr 08 00:03:23 +0000 2018	while security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, scott pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at epa. record clean air &amp; water while saving usa billions of dollars. rent was about market rate, travel expenses ok. scott is doing a great job!
Sun Apr 08 11:27:49 +0000 2018	“the fbi closed the case on hillary, which was a rigged investigation. they exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath.....” and much more. so true jesse! wattersworld
Sun Apr 08 11:44:23 +0000 2018	the washington post is far more fiction than fact. story after story is made up made garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist. story on john kelly isn’t true...just another hit job!
Sun Apr 08 11:58:13 +0000 2018	the washington post is far more fiction than fact. story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist. story on john kelly isn’t true, just another hit job!
Sun Apr 08 12:12:35 +0000 2018	president xi and i will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. china will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do. taxes will become reciprocal &amp; a deal will be made on intellectual property. great future for both countries!
Sun Apr 08 13:00:06 +0000 2018	many dead, including women and children, in mindless chemical attack in syria. area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. president putin, russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad. big price...
Sun Apr 08 13:04:22 +0000 2018	....to pay. open area immediately for medical help and verification. another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. sick!
Sun Apr 08 13:12:57 +0000 2018	if president obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand, the syrian disaster would have ended long ago! animal assad would have been history!
Mon Apr 09 00:43:27 +0000 2018	congratulations to patrick reed on his great and courageous masters win! when patrick had his amazing win at doral 5 years ago, people saw his great talent, and a bright future ahead. now he is the masters champion!
Mon Apr 09 10:03:16 +0000 2018	when a car is sent to the united states from china, there is a tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. when a car is sent to china from the united states, there is a tariff to be paid of 25%. does that sound like free or fair trade.  no, it sounds like stupid trade -  going on for years!
Mon Apr 09 19:17:39 +0000 2018	the democrats are not doing what’s right for our country. i will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law! 
Mon Apr 09 19:32:27 +0000 2018	great cabinet meeting at the whitehouse this morning!  
Tue Apr 10 11:07:58 +0000 2018	attorney–client privilege is dead!
Tue Apr 10 11:08:18 +0000 2018	a total witch hunt!!!
Tue Apr 10 13:30:35 +0000 2018	last night, it was my great honor to host america’s senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the white house. america’s military is the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. they all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform! 
Tue Apr 10 17:51:08 +0000 2018	very thankful for president xi of china’s kind words on tarrifs and automobile barriers...also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. we will make great progress together!

Tue Apr 10 21:49:56 +0000 2018	today, it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 ncaa football national champion, alabama crimson tide - to the white house. congratulations! rolltide  
Wed Apr 11 10:30:19 +0000 2018	the failing new york times wrote another phony story. it was political pundit doug schoen, not a ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (skype), hosted by doug, in ukraine. i was very positive about ukraine-another negative to the fake russia  c story!
Wed Apr 11 10:38:42 +0000 2018	so much fake news about what is going on in the white house. very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china, the coming north korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in syria. feels great to have bolton &amp; larry k on board. i (we) are
Wed Apr 11 10:47:37 +0000 2018	....doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. no collusion or obstruction (other than i fight back), so now they do the unthinkable, and raid a lawyers office for information! bad!
Wed Apr 11 10:57:30 +0000 2018	russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria. get ready russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” you shouldn’t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
Wed Apr 11 11:37:56 +0000 2018	our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the cold war. there is no reason for this. russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. stop the arms race?
Wed Apr 11 13:00:23 +0000 2018	much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake &amp; corrupt russia investigation, headed up by the all democrat loyalists, or people that worked for obama. mueller is most conflicted of all (except rosenstein who signed fisa &amp; comey letter). no collusion, so they go crazy!
Wed Apr 11 13:50:23 +0000 2018	speaker paul ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. we are with you paul!
Wed Apr 11 15:47:46 +0000 2018	the whitehouse is partnering with interior and natlparkservice to bring the nscsafety's “prescribed to death” opioid memorial to the ellipse - beginning tomorrow, april 12th to april 18th. more information:  
Wed Apr 11 19:47:07 +0000 2018	“trump just took a giant step towards actual welfare reform” 
Wed Apr 11 22:59:42 +0000 2018	honored to have republican congressional leadership join me at the whitehouse this evening. lots to discuss as we continue making america great again! 
Thu Apr 12 00:48:39 +0000 2018	big show tonight on seanhannity! 9:00 p.m. on foxnews
Thu Apr 12 10:03:46 +0000 2018	if i wanted to fire robert mueller in december, as reported by the failing new york times, i would have fired him. just more fake news from a biased newspaper!
Thu Apr 12 10:08:49 +0000 2018	california governor jerry brown is doing the right thing and sending the national guard to the border. thank you jerry, good move for the safety of our country!
Thu Apr 12 10:15:25 +0000 2018	never said when an attack on syria would take place. could be very soon or not so soon at all! in any event, the united states, under my administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of isis. where is our “thank you america?”
Thu Apr 12 10:37:16 +0000 2018	good luck to mike pompeo during his confirmation hearing today. he will be a great secretary of state!
Thu Apr 12 16:42:54 +0000 2018	on yom hashoah we remember the six million jews slaughtered in the holocaust. with each passing year, our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge neveragain. holocaustremembranceday 
Thu Apr 12 16:46:15 +0000 2018	i have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with robert mueller (unlike the clintons!). i have full confidence in ty cobb, my special counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.
Thu Apr 12 17:13:12 +0000 2018	just had an agricultural roundtable with memembers of congress and governors.  i will be making remarks on the large scale tax cuts given to american families and workers at 1:45 p.m. from the rose garden. join me live:  
Thu Apr 12 18:32:30 +0000 2018	thank you to all of the american workers who travelled here today! this event is dedicated to you: the hardworking americans who make this nation run. you love your country, you provide for your family, you have pride in your work and you cherish our great american flag! taxcuts 
Thu Apr 12 19:03:57 +0000 2018	america’s greatest treasure is our people – and my administration hears your voice and has your back. we are fighting to give every american a future of dignity, purpose and pride. american spirit is back! taxcuts 
Fri Apr 13 03:15:16 +0000 2018	would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres. obama. we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations, japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!
Fri Apr 13 11:44:51 +0000 2018	tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities. started the wall in san diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. they will soon be protected!
Fri Apr 13 12:01:47 +0000 2018	james comey is a proven leaker &amp; liar. virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. he leaked classified information, for which he should be prosecuted. he lied to congress under oath. he is a weak and.....
Fri Apr 13 12:17:37 +0000 2018	....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible director of the fbi. his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history. it was my great honor to fire james comey!
Fri Apr 13 16:21:16 +0000 2018	we are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: made in the usa! 
Fri Apr 13 19:36:27 +0000 2018	doj just issued the mccabe report - which is a total disaster. he lied! lied! lied! mccabe was totally controlled by comey - mccabe is comey!! no collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!
Sat Apr 14 01:31:56 +0000 2018	
Sat Apr 14 12:21:00 +0000 2018	a perfectly executed strike last night. thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military. could not have had a better result. mission accomplished!
Sat Apr 14 12:29:48 +0000 2018	so proud of our great military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our country has ever had. there won’t be anything, or anyone, even close!
Sun Apr 15 11:42:33 +0000 2018	unbelievably, james comey states that polls, where crooked hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the clinton email probe. in other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. slimeball!
Sun Apr 15 11:57:14 +0000 2018	the big questions in comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up classified information (jail), why did he lie to congress (jail), why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi (why didn’t they take it), why the phony memos, mccabe’s $700,000 &amp; more?
Sun Apr 15 12:08:03 +0000 2018	comey throws ag lynch “under the bus!” why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch? was she promised a supreme court seat, or ag, in order to lay off hillary. no golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
Sun Apr 15 12:19:42 +0000 2018	the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term “mission accomplished.” i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term, it should be brought back. use often!
Sun Apr 15 12:32:16 +0000 2018	i never asked comey for personal loyalty. i hardly even knew this guy. just another of his many lies. his “memos” are self serving and fake!
Sun Apr 15 12:56:13 +0000 2018	attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past. i have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. all lawyers are deflated and concerned!
Sun Apr 15 13:07:10 +0000 2018	slippery james comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the worst fbi director in history, by far!
Sun Apr 15 14:44:30 +0000 2018	just hit 50% in the rasmussen poll, much higher than president obama at same point. with all of the phony stories and fake news, it’s hard to believe! thank you america, we are doing great things.
Mon Apr 16 12:25:19 +0000 2018	comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in congress to senator g), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. disgruntled, he, mccabe, and the others, committed many crimes!
Mon Apr 16 12:31:02 +0000 2018	russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the u.s. keeps raising interest rates. not acceptable!
Tue Apr 17 12:24:34 +0000 2018	employment is up, taxes are down. enjoy!
Tue Apr 17 12:24:35 +0000 2018	i am in florida and looking forward to my meeting with prime minister abe of japan. working on trade and military security.
Tue Apr 17 12:24:36 +0000 2018	looks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border. he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border. the high crime rate will only get higher. much wanted wall in san diego already started!
Tue Apr 17 12:24:36 +0000 2018	so many people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut bill. everyone is talking, really nice to see!
Tue Apr 17 17:51:52 +0000 2018	getting ready to meet prime minister abe of japan, a truly fine gentleman!
Tue Apr 17 17:59:39 +0000 2018	rasmussen just came out at 51% approval despite the fake news media. they were one of the three most accurate on election day. just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc news/washington post, and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters). much of the media is a scam!
Tue Apr 17 20:45:36 +0000 2018	welcome prime minister abe! 
Tue Apr 17 21:34:23 +0000 2018	today’s court decision means that congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons. this is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by....
Tue Apr 17 21:34:23 +0000 2018	....congress – house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. keep america safe!
Tue Apr 17 22:59:20 +0000 2018	states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!
Wed Apr 18 00:05:55 +0000 2018	.flotus melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush:

Wed Apr 18 02:32:04 +0000 2018	pastor andrew brunson, a fine gentleman and christian leader in the united states, is on trial and being persecuted in turkey for no reason. they call him a spy, but i am more a spy than he is. hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!
Wed Apr 18 02:49:28 +0000 2018	while japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp, i don’t like the deal for the united states. too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for our workers. look how bad wto is to u.s.
Wed Apr 18 09:59:07 +0000 2018	there is a revolution going on in california. soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous, crime infested &amp; breeding concept. jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border, but the people of the state are not happy. want security &amp; safety now!
Wed Apr 18 10:08:50 +0000 2018	a sketch years later about a nonexistent man. a total con job, playing the fake news media for fools (but they know it)! 
Wed Apr 18 10:42:23 +0000 2018	mike pompeo met with kim jong un in north korea last week. meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. details of summit are being worked out now. denuclearization will be a great thing for world, but also for north korea!
Wed Apr 18 12:05:42 +0000 2018	slippery james comey, the worst fbi director in history, was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where, by the way, there was no collusion (except by the dems)!
Wed Apr 18 16:30:39 +0000 2018	best wishes to prime minister netanyahu and all of the people of israel on the 70th anniversary of your great independence. we have no better friends anywhere. looking forward to moving our embassy to jerusalem next month!
Wed Apr 18 21:00:12 +0000 2018	prime minister abeshinzo of japan and myself this morning building an even deeper and better relationship while playing a quick round of golf at trump international golf club. 
Wed Apr 18 21:32:53 +0000 2018	great working luncheon with u.s. and japanese delegations this afternoon! 
Thu Apr 19 02:58:21 +0000 2018	it was my great honor to host my friend jpn_pmo abeshinzo and his delegation at mar-a-lago for the past two days. lots accomplished, thank you! success 
Thu Apr 19 14:45:14 +0000 2018	great meeting with prime minister abe of japan, who has just left florida. talked in depth about north korea, military and trade. good things will happen!
Thu Apr 19 15:23:22 +0000 2018	thank you san diego county for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against california's illegal and unconstitutional 'sanctuary' policies. california's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all americans at risk.
Thu Apr 19 15:48:38 +0000 2018	governor jerry brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 national guard troops” to do nothing. the crime rate in california is high enough, and the federal government will not be paying for governor brown’s charade. we need border security and action, not words!
Thu Apr 19 16:23:52 +0000 2018	just arrived naskeywest! heading to a briefing with the joint interagency task force south, northcom and southcom. 
Thu Apr 19 18:33:24 +0000 2018	thank you jiatfsouth, norad_northcom, southcomwatch and dhsgov. keep up the great work!

Fri May 04 10:22:31 +0000 2018	our southern border is under siege. congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. must build a wall. mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help!
Fri May 04 10:28:58 +0000 2018	because jobs in the u.s. are doing so well, americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. great!

Fri May 04 10:45:31 +0000 2018	nbc news is wrong again! they cite “sources” which are constantly wrong. problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don’t exist, they are fabricated, fiction! nbc, my former home with the apprentice, is now as bad as fake news cnn. sad!

Fri May 04 21:58:44 +0000 2018	democrats and liberals in congress want to disarm law-abiding americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. politicians who put criminal aliens before american citizens should be voted out of office!
Fri May 04 21:59:28 +0000 2018	we are going to demand congress secure the border in the upcoming cr. illegal immigration must end!
Fri May 04 22:56:13 +0000 2018	i want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the nra. we will never fail, and we will always protect your second amendment! god bless you, and god bless america!

Sat May 05 00:31:30 +0000 2018	our high level delegation is on the way back from china where they had long meetings with chinese leaders and business representatives. we will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for china in that they have become very spoiled with u.s. trade wins!

Mon May 07 10:53:49 +0000 2018	to the great people of west virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. problem is, don blankenship, currently running for senate, can’t win the general election in your state...no way! remember alabama. vote rep. jenkins or a.g. morrisey!
Mon May 07 11:04:47 +0000 2018	my highly respected nominee for cia director, gina haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists. think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who democrats want out because she is too tough on terror. win gina!
Mon May 07 11:27:34 +0000 2018	the russia witch hunt is rapidly losing credibility. house intelligence committee found no collusion, coordination or anything else with russia. so now the probe says ok, what else is there? how about obstruction for a made up, phony crime.there is no o, it’s called fighting back
Mon May 07 11:39:53 +0000 2018	the 13 angry democrats in charge of the russian witch hunt are starting to find out that there is a court system in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the courts get to see your unrevealed conflicts of interest!
Mon May 07 13:00:18 +0000 2018	“the great revolt” by salena zito and brad todd does much to tell the story of our great election victory. the forgotten men &amp; women are forgotten no longer!

Mon May 07 13:35:32 +0000 2018	is this phony witch hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the mid-term elections, which is what the democrats always intended? republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!
Mon May 07 14:08:37 +0000 2018	the united states does not need john kerry’s possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated iran deal.  he was the one that created this mess in the first place!
Mon May 07 17:20:50 +0000 2018	national prescription drug takebackday numbers are in! another record broken: nearly 1 million pounds of rx pills disposed! let’s keep fighting this opioid epidemic, america!

Tue May 08 18:52:00 +0000 2018	statement on the iran nuclear deal: 
Tue May 08 22:11:13 +0000 2018	the iran deal is defective at its core. if we do nothing, we know what will happen. in just a short time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.... 
Wed May 09 11:24:20 +0000 2018	the republican party had a great night. tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in november. the economy is sooo strong, and with nancy pelosi wanting to end the big tax cuts and raise taxes, why wouldn’t we win?
Wed May 09 11:38:45 +0000 2018	the fake news is working overtime. just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy &amp; all things else, 91% of the network news about me is negative (fake). why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? take away credentials?
Wed May 09 11:48:17 +0000 2018	candace owens of turning point usa is having a big impact on politics in our country. she represents an ever expanding group of very smart “thinkers,” and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our country!
Wed May 09 12:00:30 +0000 2018	congratulations to mike dewine on his big win in the great state of ohio. he will be a great governor with a heavy focus on healthcare and jobs.  his socialist opponent in november should not do well, a big failure in last job!
Wed May 09 12:30:56 +0000 2018	i am pleased to inform you that secretary of state mike pompeo is in the air and on his way back from north korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. they seem to be in good health. also, good meeting with kim jong un. date &amp; place set.
Wed May 09 12:35:51 +0000 2018	secretary pompeo and his “guests” will be landing at andrews air force base at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. i will be there to greet them. very exciting!
Wed May 09 22:38:10 +0000 2018	the failing new york times criticized secretary of state pompeo for being awol (missing), when in fact he was flying to north korea. fake news, so bad!
Wed May 09 22:41:03 +0000 2018	looking forward to greeting the hostages (no longer) at 2:00 a.m.
Thu May 10 02:19:02 +0000 2018	gina haspel did a spectacular job today. there is nobody even close to run the cia!
Thu May 10 10:01:43 +0000 2018	on behalf of the american people, welcome home! 
Thu May 10 14:30:27 +0000 2018	senator cryin’ chuck schumer fought hard against the bad iran deal, even going at it with president obama, &amp; then voted against it! now he says i should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that! same with comey. thought he was terrible until i fired him!
Thu May 10 14:33:00 +0000 2018	five most wanted leaders of isis just captured!

Fri May 11 19:30:16 +0000 2018	today, my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the american people. we will have tougher negotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter! 
Fri May 11 20:56:25 +0000 2018	the american people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them. we will work every day to ensure all americans have access to the quality, affordable medication they need and deserve. we will not rest until the job is done! 
Fri May 11 23:39:01 +0000 2018	big week next week when the american embassy in israel will be moved to jerusalem. congratulations to all!
Fri May 11 23:49:40 +0000 2018	why doesn’t the fake news media state that the trump administration’s anti-trust division has been, and is, opposed to the at&amp;t purchase of time warner in a currently ongoing trial. such a disgrace in reporting!
Sat May 12 21:08:55 +0000 2018	north korea has announced that they will dismantle nuclear test site this month, ahead of the big summit meeting on june 12th. thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!
Sat May 12 22:02:55 +0000 2018	iran’s military budget is up more than 40% since the obama negotiated nuclear deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. but not anymore!
Sat May 12 22:20:16 +0000 2018	the senate should get funding done before the august break, or not go home. wall and border security should be included. also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. stay!
Sun May 13 12:29:08 +0000 2018	happy mother’s day!!! 
Sun May 13 15:01:00 +0000 2018	president xi of china, and i, are working together to give massive chinese phone company, zte, a way to get back into business, fast. too many jobs in china lost. commerce department has been instructed to get it done!
Sun May 13 19:22:03 +0000 2018	china and the united states are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. but be cool, it will all work out!
Sun May 13 20:11:33 +0000 2018	remember how badly iran was behaving with the iran deal in place. they were trying to take over the middle east by whatever means necessary. now, that will not happen!
Mon May 14 00:03:21 +0000 2018	so sad to see the terror attack in paris. at some point countries will have to open their eyes &amp; see what is really going on. this kind of sickness &amp; hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, &amp; successful country! changes to our thought process on terror must be made.
Mon May 14 10:54:15 +0000 2018	u.s. embassy opening in jerusalem will be covered live on foxnews &amp; foxbusiness. lead up to 9:00 a.m. (eastern) event has already begun. a great day for israel!
Mon May 14 13:36:25 +0000 2018	big day for israel. congratulations!
Mon May 14 15:16:38 +0000 2018	usembassyjerusalem 
Mon May 14 20:06:53 +0000 2018	zte, the large chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from u.s. companies. this is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with china and my personal relationship with president xi.
Mon May 14 20:46:25 +0000 2018	the so-called leaks coming out of the white house are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the fake news media in order to make us look as bad as possible. with that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!
Mon May 14 21:09:16 +0000 2018	heading over to walter reed medical center to see our great first lady, melania. successful procedure, she is in good spirits. thank you to all of the well-wishers!
Tue May 15 12:26:59 +0000 2018	our great first lady is doing really well. will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. thank you for so much love and support!
Tue May 15 12:35:30 +0000 2018	trade negotiations are continuing with china. they have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the u.s., for many years. stay tuned!
Tue May 15 14:08:21 +0000 2018	can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories i get from the fake news media, together with the  $10,000,000 russian witch hunt (there is no collusion), i now have my best poll numbers in a year. much of the media may be corrupt, but the people truly get it!
Tue May 15 17:30:16 +0000 2018	nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and vote for deb fischer today! 
Tue May 15 18:39:58 +0000 2018	today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year – the day we pay tribute to the law enforcement heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty. they made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace. we stand with our police (heroes) 100%!

Wed May 16 12:25:42 +0000 2018	congratulations to deb fischer. the people of nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! maga
Wed May 16 13:09:19 +0000 2018	the washington post and cnn have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with china. nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china...
Wed May 16 13:09:20 +0000 2018	...we have not seen china’s demands yet, which should be few in that previous u.s. administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. china has seen our demands. there has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings...
Wed May 16 13:09:20 +0000 2018	...haven’t even started yet! the u.s. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. china has much to give!
Wed May 16 17:21:18 +0000 2018	house votes today on choice/mission act. who will stand with our great vets, caregivers, and veterans service organizations? must get choice passed by memorial day!
Wed May 16 17:50:58 +0000 2018	today, it was my great honor to welcome president mirziyoyev of uzbekistan to the whitehouse! 
Wed May 16 18:40:35 +0000 2018	lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent, bob casey, has been a do-nothing senator who only shows up at election time. he votes along the nancy pelosi, elizabeth warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare...
Wed May 16 18:40:36 +0000 2018	...and voted against the massive tax cut bill. he’s also weak on borders and crime. sadly, our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr. lou barletta will win! maga
Wed May 16 22:57:25 +0000 2018	gina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia. she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately. we need her to keep our great country safe! confirmgina
Thu May 17 11:28:09 +0000 2018	congratulations america, we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american history...and there is still no collusion and no obstruction. the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money!
Thu May 17 11:56:15 +0000 2018	wow, word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi “spied on the trump campaign with an imbedded informant.” andrew mccarthy says, “there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” if so, this is bigger than watergate!
Thu May 17 12:45:03 +0000 2018	wow, word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi “spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant.” andrew mccarthy says, “there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” if so, this is bigger than watergate!
Thu May 17 13:52:44 +0000 2018	despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted witch hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in u.s. history - by far! sorry to the fake news media and “haters,” but that’s the way it is!
Thu May 17 15:25:57 +0000 2018	congrats to the house for passing the va mission act yesterday. without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. putting politics over our veterans care is unacceptable – senate must vote yes on this bill by memorial day!
Thu May 17 21:00:12 +0000 2018	congratulations to our new cia director, gina haspel! 
Thu May 17 21:27:52 +0000 2018	talking trade with the vice premier of the people’s republic of china, liu he. 
Thu May 17 21:53:51 +0000 2018	great talk with my friend president mauricio macri of argentina this week. he is doing such a good job for argentina. i support his vision for transforming his country’s economy and unleashing its potential!
Thu May 17 22:14:23 +0000 2018	tomorrow, the house will vote on a strong farm bill, which includes work requirements. we must support our nation’s great farmers!
Thu May 17 22:17:08 +0000 2018	it was my great honor to visit with our heroes last night at walter reed medical center. there is nobody like them! 
Fri May 18 10:24:53 +0000 2018	“apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign. this has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn’t commit.”  david asman  loudobbs greggjarrett   really bad stuff!
Fri May 18 10:51:43 +0000 2018	fake news media had me calling immigrants, or illegal immigrants, “animals.” wrong! they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. i referred to ms 13 gang members as “animals,” a big difference - and so true. fake news got it purposely wrong, as usual!
Fri May 18 13:38:11 +0000 2018	why isn’t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700,000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia, led by clinton best friend terry m (under fbi investigation that they killed) gave to mccabe’s wife in her run for office? then dropped case on clinton!
Fri May 18 13:50:11 +0000 2018	reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. it took place very early on, and long before the phony russia hoax became a “hot” fake news story. if true - all time biggest political scandal!
Fri May 18 15:05:35 +0000 2018	school shooting in texas. early reports not looking good. god bless all!
Fri May 18 16:34:24 +0000 2018	we grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in texas. to the students, families, teachers and personnel at santa fe high school – we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever... 
Fri May 18 20:22:25 +0000 2018	america is a nation that believes in the power of redemption. america is a nation that believes in second chances - and america is a nation that believes that the best is always yet to come! prisonreform 
Fri May 18 20:41:21 +0000 2018	just met with un secretary-general antónio guterres who is working hard to “make the united nations great again.” when the un does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the u.s. has less to do and we save money. nikkihaley is doing a fantastic job! 
Fri May 18 22:00:58 +0000 2018	california finally deserves a great governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. john cox is the man - he’ll be the best governor you’ve ever had. i fully endorse john cox for governor and look forward to working with him to make california great again!
Fri May 18 22:57:09 +0000 2018	america is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. we have ended the war on coal, and will continue to work to promote american energy dominance!
Sat May 19 18:00:43 +0000 2018	happy armedforcesday to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation!

Sat May 19 18:37:39 +0000 2018	great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melania is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
Sat May 19 21:27:48 +0000 2018	if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee (also, senate judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. drain the swamp!
Sun May 20 13:04:21 +0000 2018	things are really getting ridiculous. the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) nytimes has done a long &amp; boring story indicating that the world’s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia &amp; me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!
Sun May 20 13:11:05 +0000 2018	....at what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 witch hunt, composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years, stop! they have found no collussion with russia, no obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption...
Sun May 20 13:19:34 +0000 2018	...in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33,000 emails, got $145,000,000 while secretary of state, paid mccabes wife $700,000 (and got off the fbi hook along with terry m) and so much more. republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam.
Sun May 20 13:29:32 +0000 2018	now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world, they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party. don’t worry about dems fisa abuse, missing emails or fraudulent dossier!
Sun May 20 13:37:34 +0000 2018	what ever happened to the server, at the center of so much corruption, that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of democrats) fbi? they broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the server?
Sun May 20 14:04:24 +0000 2018	....and why hasn’t the podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington, d.c.?
Sun May 20 17:13:47 +0000 2018	the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the world. oh’ great!
Sun May 20 17:37:40 +0000 2018	i hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration!
Mon May 21 11:21:29 +0000 2018	i ask senator chuck schumer, why didn’t president obama &amp; the democrats do something about trade with china, including theft of intellectual property etc.? they did nothing! with that being said, chuck &amp; i have long agreed on this issue! fair trade, plus, with china will happen!
Mon May 21 11:27:42 +0000 2018	china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
Mon May 21 11:31:16 +0000 2018	on china, barriers and tariffs to come down for first time.
Mon May 21 11:40:22 +0000 2018	china must continue to be strong &amp; tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made. the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. i want this to happen, and north korea to be very successful, but only after signing!

Wed May 23 01:13:46 +0000 2018	if the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...
Wed May 23 01:13:46 +0000 2018	...follow the money! the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia, because there was no collusion. he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders, who got duped!
Wed May 23 10:45:37 +0000 2018	foxandfriends  “new bombshell in the obama spying scandal. did other agencies spy on trump campaign?” even clapper, worlds dumbest former intelligence head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word spy when describing the illegal activities!
Wed May 23 10:54:01 +0000 2018	look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state. they go after phony collusion with russia, a made up scam, and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! what goes around, comes around!

Wed May 23 11:33:59 +0000 2018	“trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign” no, james clapper, i am not happy. spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!
Wed May 23 11:55:35 +0000 2018	our trade deal with china is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.

Thu May 24 12:21:08 +0000 2018	clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign. large dollars were paid to the spy, far beyond normal. starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in u.s. history. spygate - a terrible thing!
Thu May 24 12:34:29 +0000 2018	not surprisingly, the great men &amp; women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey, mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi. comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi! spygate

Fri May 25 11:50:37 +0000 2018	i will be making the commencment address today at the united states naval academy in annapolis, maryland. look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!
Fri May 25 12:04:16 +0000 2018	the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a spy, as illegal as that may be. but what about an “informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the russian hoax?
Fri May 25 12:04:17 +0000 2018	can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? and to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, lost!
Fri May 25 12:04:19 +0000 2018	“everyone knows there was a spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spy...widespread spying involving multiple people.” mollie hemingway, the federalist senior editor  but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story!
Fri May 25 12:04:20 +0000 2018	democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea. just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals &amp; must be nurtured, or asking to end your big tax cuts &amp; raise your taxes instead. dems have lost touch!
Fri May 25 12:14:07 +0000 2018	very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea. we will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. only time (and talent) will tell!

Fri May 25 22:14:54 +0000 2018	chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job. the killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!
Fri May 25 22:45:32 +0000 2018	funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states. lost almost $800 billion/year under “o”
Fri May 25 23:07:19 +0000 2018	senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks. i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase u.s. parts and pay a $1.3 billion fine. dems do nothing....
Fri May 25 23:13:19 +0000 2018	...but complain and obstruct. they made only bad deals (iran) and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world!
Sat May 26 00:37:35 +0000 2018	we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in singapore on the same date, june 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.

Sat May 26 15:03:33 +0000 2018	unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe, there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to  how to deal with north korea...and if there was, it wouldn’t matter. the nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!
Sat May 26 15:21:10 +0000 2018	the failing nytimes quotes “a senior white house official,” who doesn’t exist, as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on june 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.” wrong again! use real people, not phony sources.
Sat May 26 19:28:04 +0000 2018	with spies, or “informants” as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or “justice” contact me to tell me of the  phony russia problem?
Sat May 26 19:41:50 +0000 2018	this whole russia probe is rigged. just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven’t been lost in decades. 13 angry democrats, and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years. spygate &amp; conflicts of interest!
Sat May 26 19:56:52 +0000 2018	when will the 13 angry democrats (&amp; those who worked for president o), reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest? it’s been a long time now! will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems, justice, fbi &amp; russia?
Sun May 27 01:49:54 +0000 2018	welcome home josh! 
Sun May 27 12:41:24 +0000 2018	who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt? they journeyed down to washington, d.c., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...they went back home in tatters!
Sun May 27 13:14:04 +0000 2018	fantastic to have 400,000 great men &amp; women of rolling thunder in d.c. showing their patriotism. they love our country, they love our flag, they stand for our national anthem! thanks to executive director artie muller.
Sun May 27 14:13:24 +0000 2018	why didn’t the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton, many crimes, much collusion with russia? why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc?  rigged investigation!
Sun May 27 20:09:12 +0000 2018	our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself. i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day. kim jong un agrees with me on this. it will happen!
Sun May 27 20:32:33 +0000 2018	why didn’t president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election? because he thought crooked hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! he was in charge, not me, and did nothing.
Mon May 28 11:01:47 +0000 2018	memorialday 
Mon May 28 12:58:07 +0000 2018	happy memorial day! those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever (&amp; women in 18years), rebuilding our military and so much more. nice!

Mon May 28 14:32:31 +0000 2018	“we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation. that raises legitimate questions. i just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.” jonathan turley on foxnews
Mon May 28 17:13:04 +0000 2018	thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance. we are gathered here on the sacred soil of arlingtonnatl cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of america's greatest heroes, the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom. memorialday 
Mon May 28 17:14:45 +0000 2018	the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields, in cemeteries, battlefields, and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life. they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies, from privilege and from poverty... 
Mon May 28 17:19:33 +0000 2018	our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny. they saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served. they cared for their families more than anything in the world, they loved their families. they inspired their communities... 
Mon May 28 21:22:15 +0000 2018	a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts (no chance). this is too good to be true for republicans...remember, the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime, the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang members...not good!
Mon May 28 21:53:56 +0000 2018	california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others. on june 5th., vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox, a really good and highly competent man. he’ll make california great again!
Tue May 29 10:07:26 +0000 2018	democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obama’s term showing children from the border in steel cages. they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of country...bipartisan bill!
Tue May 29 10:30:32 +0000 2018	we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea. meetings are currently taking place concerning summit, and more. kim young chol, the vice chairman of north korea, heading now to new york. solid response to my letter, thank you!
Tue May 29 10:49:23 +0000 2018	“this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. it wasn’t just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the trump campaign...people call that spying...this is unprecedented and  scandalous.” mollie hemingway
Tue May 29 11:00:02 +0000 2018	the 13 angry democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for obama) working on the rigged russia witch hunt, will be meddling with the mid-term elections, especially now that republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in polls. there was no collusion, except by the democrats!
Tue May 29 11:09:32 +0000 2018	why aren’t the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton. it’s a rigged witch hunt, that’s why! ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
Tue May 29 11:27:07 +0000 2018	sorry, i’ve got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear, bad trade deals, va choice, the economy, rebuilding the military, and so much more, and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etc.
Tue May 29 13:30:24 +0000 2018	the fake mainstream media has, from the time i announced i was running for president, run the most highly sophisticated &amp; dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics. no matter how well we do, they find fault. but the forgotten men &amp; women won, i’m president!
Wed May 30 12:46:57 +0000 2018	rep.trey gowdy, “i don’t think so, i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. if i were the president and i picked someone to be the country’s....
Wed May 30 12:47:04 +0000 2018	....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ‘oh by the way i’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, i would be frustrated too...and that’s how i read that - senator sessions, why didn’t you tell me before i picked you.....
Wed May 30 12:47:07 +0000 2018	....there are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!” and i wish i did!
Wed May 30 14:35:07 +0000 2018	the failing and corrupt nytimes estimated the crowd last night at “1000 people,” when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’. this is the way they demean and disparage. they are very dishonest people who don’t “get” me, and never did!
Wed May 30 15:31:01 +0000 2018	bob iger of abc called valerie jarrett to let her know that “abc does not tolerate comments like those” made by roseanne barr. gee, he never called president donald j. trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc. maybe i just didn’t get the call?
Wed May 30 17:09:38 +0000 2018	today i am proud to keep another promise to the american people as i sign the righttotry legislation into law. 
Wed May 30 17:11:58 +0000 2018	with the righttotry law i signed today, patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions. these are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise...

Wed May 30 23:46:15 +0000 2018	there is no one better to represent the people of n.y. and staten island (a place i know very well) than repdandonovan, who is strong on borders &amp; crime, loves our military &amp; our vets, voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again. dan has my full endorsement!
Thu May 31 00:08:50 +0000 2018	very importantly, repdandonovan will win for the republicans in november...and his opponent will not. remember alabama. we can’t take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat!
Thu May 31 03:06:28 +0000 2018	the soon to be released book, “the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump,” written by gregg jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit. the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see! out in 5 weeks.
Thu May 31 03:21:26 +0000 2018	“the recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united states.” joe digenova, former u.s. attorney.
Thu May 31 10:55:14 +0000 2018	rush limbaugh  “if the fbi was so concerned, and if they weren’t targeting trump, they should have told trump. if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? why not tell trump? because they were pushing this scam.”
Thu May 31 11:53:08 +0000 2018	iger, where is my call of apology? you and abc have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. how is brian ross doing? he tanked the market with an abc lie, yet no apology. double standard!
Thu May 31 12:05:20 +0000 2018	the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, spies (informants), into my campaign! surveillance much?
Thu May 31 12:11:01 +0000 2018	not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia! the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!
Thu May 31 13:15:28 +0000 2018	very good meetings with north korea.
Thu May 31 13:18:35 +0000 2018	will be giving a full pardon to dinesh d’souza today. he was treated very unfairly by our government!

Fri Jun 01 11:15:31 +0000 2018	why aren’t they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? a total double standard but that’s o.k., we are winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!

Fri Jun 01 13:18:21 +0000 2018	canada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. highly restrictive on trade! they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! they report a really high surplus on trade with us. do timber &amp; lumber in u.s.?

Sat Jun 02 17:51:38 +0000 2018	the united states must, at long last, be treated fairly on trade. if we charge a country zero to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated. that is not free or fair trade, it is stupid trade!
Sat Jun 02 20:57:30 +0000 2018	why is it that the wall street journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the u.s. by other countries, or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into u.s. coffers?
Sat Jun 02 21:23:15 +0000 2018	when you’re almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade, you can’t lose a trade war! the u.s. has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade, time to get smart!

Sun Jun 03 13:25:18 +0000 2018	as only one of two people left who could become president, why wouldn’t the fbi or department of “justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? should have told me!
Sun Jun 03 13:34:19 +0000 2018	....paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented ronald reagan, bob dole &amp; many others over the years), but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn’t have been hired!
Sun Jun 03 17:25:00 +0000 2018	mark penn  “why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff? why is there an independent councel? to go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...constitution was set up to prevent this...stormtrooper tactics almost.” a disgrace!

Mon Jun 04 11:35:50 +0000 2018	this is my 500th. day in office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any president in his first 500 days. massive tax &amp; regulation cuts, military &amp; vets, lower crime &amp; illegal immigration, stronger borders, judgeships, best economy &amp; jobs ever, and much more...
Mon Jun 04 12:18:07 +0000 2018	....we had repeal &amp; replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway. individual mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month. drug prices coming down &amp; right to try!

Mon Jun 04 12:35:25 +0000 2018	as has been stated by numerous legal scholars, i have the absolute right to pardon myself, but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong? in the meantime, the never ending witch hunt, led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats (&amp; others) continues into the mid-terms!
Mon Jun 04 12:41:47 +0000 2018	china already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans. canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products. not acceptable!
Mon Jun 04 12:43:38 +0000 2018	the u.s. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win!
Mon Jun 04 13:07:17 +0000 2018	the appointment of the special councel is totally unconstitutional! despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrong!
Mon Jun 04 13:47:43 +0000 2018	farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. mexico, canada, china and others have treated them unfairly. by the time i finish trade talks, that will change. big trade barriers against u.s. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken. massive trade deficits no longer!
Mon Jun 04 14:01:40 +0000 2018	the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional! despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrong!

Mon Jun 04 20:41:55 +0000 2018	the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt.

Tue Jun 05 02:55:56 +0000 2018	the philadelphia eagles football team was invited to the white house. unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. staying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. sorry!
Tue Jun 05 10:38:51 +0000 2018	what is taking so long with the inspector general’s report on crooked hillary and slippery james comey. numerous delays. hope report is not being changed and made weaker! there are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. transparency!

Tue Jun 05 11:31:47 +0000 2018	the russian witch hunt hoax continues, all because jeff sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself...i would have quickly picked someone else. so much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion!

Tue Jun 05 20:07:04 +0000 2018	imagine how much wasteful spending we’d save if we didn’t have chuck and nancy standing in our way! for years, democrats in congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end? no more.

Wed Jun 06 00:37:50 +0000 2018	wow, strzok-page, the incompetent &amp; corrupt fbi lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign dating way back to december, 2015. spygate is in full force! is the mainstream media interested yet? big stuff!
Wed Jun 06 01:02:36 +0000 2018	great interview by loudobbs with chris farrell of judicial watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign. spygate at the highest level. who would believe?
Wed Jun 06 01:23:44 +0000 2018	chris farrell, judicial watch. “they were running an operation to undermine a candidate for president of the u.s. these are all violations of law. this is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. there’s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...
Wed Jun 06 01:27:03 +0000 2018	...this is a level of criminality beyond the pale. this is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it’s like nothing else we’ve seen in our history. this makes the nixon watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
Wed Jun 06 01:33:37 +0000 2018	....the greatest witch hunt in political history!
Wed Jun 06 04:02:00 +0000 2018	mitch mcconnell announced he will cancel the senate’s august recess. great, maybe the democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of high crime and high taxes. we need border security!
Wed Jun 06 13:16:34 +0000 2018	great night for republicans! congratulations to john cox on a really big number in california. he can win. even fake news cnn said the trump impact was really big, much bigger than they ever thought possible. so much for the big blue wave, it may be a big red wave. working hard!
Wed Jun 06 13:37:22 +0000 2018	gold star father, ceejay metcalf, whose great son michael was just honored at the white house, was fantastic this morning on foxandfriends. he is a special man!
Wed Jun 06 13:48:20 +0000 2018	the fake news media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great first lady, melania. during her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the w.h. (and me) for n.y. or virginia, to abuse. all fake, she is doing really well!
Wed Jun 06 13:54:17 +0000 2018	...four reporters spotted melania in the white house last week walking merrily along to a meeting. they never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. fake news is really bad!
Wed Jun 06 14:04:29 +0000 2018	many more republican voters showed up yesterday than the fake news thought possible. the political pundits just don’t get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! remember, dems are high tax, high crime, easy to beat!
Wed Jun 06 14:43:35 +0000 2018	congratulations to dana rohrabacher on his big california win. we are proud of you dana!

Wed Jun 06 21:41:09 +0000 2018	thank you to everyone at fema hq for today’s briefing on preparations for the upcoming hurricane season. disaster response and recovery is best achieved when it’s federally supported, state managed, and locally executed – this is the successful model we will continue to build. 
Thu Jun 07 11:57:03 +0000 2018	isn’t it ironic? getting ready to go to the g-7 in canada to fight for our country on trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to singapore to meet with north korea &amp; the nuclear problem...but back home we still have the 13 angry democrats pushing the witch hunt!
Thu Jun 07 12:07:10 +0000 2018	good luck to alice johnson. have a wonderful life!
Thu Jun 07 12:58:39 +0000 2018	alan dershowitz, harvard law professor: “it all proves that we never needed a special councel....all of this could have been done by the justice dept. don’t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone’s back. not the way justice should operate.” so true!

Thu Jun 07 13:07:56 +0000 2018	when and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 angry democrats (plus) working on the witch hunt hoax. there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election. where is the server?
Thu Jun 07 13:49:41 +0000 2018	how could jeff flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn’t have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again? let’s face it, he’s a flake!
Thu Jun 07 14:01:01 +0000 2018	looking forward to seeing my friend prime minister abeshinzo of japan at noon. will be discussing north korea and trade.
Thu Jun 07 14:07:16 +0000 2018	our justice department must not let awan &amp; debbie wasserman schultz off the hook. the democrat i.t. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. they want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their server. where is server? really bad!
Thu Jun 07 15:10:46 +0000 2018	when will people start saying, “thank you, mr. president, for firing james comey?”
Thu Jun 07 15:15:21 +0000 2018	the obama administration is now accused of trying to give iran secret access to the financial system of the united states. this is totally illegal. perhaps we could get the 13 angry democrats to divert some of their energy to this “matter” (as comey would call it). investigate!
Thu Jun 07 15:42:17 +0000 2018	making america great again!

Thu Jun 07 19:51:41 +0000 2018	today, i am greatly honored to welcome my good friend, pm abe of japan to the whitehouse. over the past 16 months the prime minister and i have worked closely together to address common challenges, of which there are many... 
Thu Jun 07 19:55:47 +0000 2018	pm abe and i are also working to improve the trading relationship between the u.s. and japan, something we have to do. the u.s. seeks a bilateral deal with japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. we’re working hard to reduce our trade imbalance... 
Thu Jun 07 20:02:08 +0000 2018	great day of meetings with prime minister abeshinzo of japan! 
Thu Jun 07 22:04:04 +0000 2018	please tell prime minister trudeau and president macron that they are charging the u.s. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. the eu trade surplus with the u.s. is $151 billion, and canada keeps our farmers and others out. look forward to seeing them tomorrow.
Thu Jun 07 23:44:47 +0000 2018	prime minister trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the u.s. and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our farmers, killing our agriculture!
Fri Jun 08 02:15:37 +0000 2018	why isn’t the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers against the u.s. totally unfair to our farmers, workers &amp; companies. take down your tariffs &amp; barriers or we will more than match you!
Fri Jun 08 10:06:20 +0000 2018	obama, schumer and pelosi did nothing about north korea, and now weak on crime, high tax schumer is telling me what to do at the summit the dems could never set up. schumer failed with north korea and iran, we don’t need his advice!
Fri Jun 08 10:16:39 +0000 2018	canada charges the u.s. a 270%  tariff on dairy products! they didn’t tell you that, did they? not fair to our farmers!
Fri Jun 08 10:25:35 +0000 2018	looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the g-7 countries. if it doesn’t happen, we come out even better!
Fri Jun 08 11:12:57 +0000 2018	congratulations to the washington capitals on their great play and winning the stanley cup championship. alex ovechkin, the team captain, was spectacular - a true superstar! d.c. is popping, in many ways. what a time!
Fri Jun 08 11:22:44 +0000 2018	i am heading for canada and the g-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the united states. from there i go to singapore and talks with north korea on denuclearization. won’t be talking about the russian witch hunt hoax for a while!
Sat Jun 09 01:24:22 +0000 2018	my thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in somolia. they are truly all heroes.

Sat Jun 09 20:33:56 +0000 2018	henry mcmaster loves the people of south carolina and was with me from the beginning. he is strong on crime and borders, great for our military and our vets. he is doing a fantastic job as your governor, and has my full endorsement, a special guy. vote on tuesday!
Sat Jun 09 20:43:08 +0000 2018	just met the new prime minister of italy, giuseppeconteit, a really great guy. he will be honored in washington, at the whitehouse, shortly. he will do a great job - the people of italy got it right!
Sat Jun 09 20:56:33 +0000 2018	just left the g7 summit in beautiful canada. great meetings and relationships with the six country leaders especially since they know i cannot allow them to apply large tariffs and strong barriers to...
Sat Jun 09 20:56:34 +0000 2018	...u.s.a. trade. they fully understand where i am coming from. after many decades, fair and reciprocal trade will happen!
Sat Jun 09 20:57:12 +0000 2018	the united states will not allow other countries to impose massive tariffs and trade barriers on its farmers, workers and companies. while sending their product into our country tax free. we have put up with trade abuse for many decades — and that is long enough.
Sat Jun 09 20:58:14 +0000 2018	i am on my way to singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for north korea and the world. it will certainly be an exciting day and i know that kim jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before...
Sat Jun 09 20:58:15 +0000 2018	…create peace and great prosperity for his land. i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!
Sat Jun 09 23:03:16 +0000 2018	based on justin’s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our u.s. farmers, workers and companies, i have instructed our u.s. reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the u.s. market!
Sat Jun 09 23:04:54 +0000 2018	pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our g7 meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that, “us tariffs were kind of insulting” and he “will not be pushed around.” very dishonest &amp; weak. our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!
Mon Jun 11 01:05:07 +0000 2018	fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal. according to a canada release, they make almost 100 billion dollars in trade with u.s. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). minimum is 17b. tax dairy from us at 270%. then justin acts hurt when called out!
Mon Jun 11 01:17:17 +0000 2018	why should i, as president of the united states, allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses, as they have for decades, while our farmers, workers &amp; taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? not fair to the people of america! $800 billion trade deficit...
Mon Jun 11 01:29:29 +0000 2018	....and add to that the fact that the u.s. pays close to the entire cost of nato-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). the european union had a $151 billion surplus-should pay much more for military!
Mon Jun 11 01:42:35 +0000 2018	....germany pays 1% (slowly) of gdp towards nato, while we pay 4% of a much larger gdp. does anybody believe that makes sense? we protect europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on trade. change is coming!
Mon Jun 11 01:45:11 +0000 2018	great to be in singapore, excitement in the air!
Mon Jun 11 02:41:02 +0000 2018	sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on trade anymore. we must put the american worker first!
Mon Jun 11 07:51:06 +0000 2018	thank you prime minister lee hsien loong! 
Mon Jun 11 21:27:21 +0000 2018	meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end, that doesn’t matter. we will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!
Mon Jun 11 21:52:36 +0000 2018	stock market up almost 40% since the election, with 7 trillion dollars of u.s. value built throughout the economy. lowest unemployment rate in many decades, with black &amp; hispanic unemployment lowest in history, and female unemployment lowest in 21 years. highest confidence ever!
Mon Jun 11 22:04:01 +0000 2018	the fact that i am having a meeting is a major loss for the u.s., say the haters &amp; losers. we have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say! we will be fine!
Tue Jun 12 00:03:23 +0000 2018	just won big supreme court decision on voting! great news!

Tue Jun 12 20:12:43 +0000 2018	mark sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to maga. he is mia and nothing but trouble. he is better off in argentina. i fully endorse katie arrington for congress in sc, a state i love. she is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. vote katie!
Tue Jun 12 20:40:26 +0000 2018	heading back home from singapore after a truly amazing visit. great progress was made on the denuclearization of north korea. hostages are back home, will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families, no missiles shot, no research happening, sites closing...

Wed Jun 13 00:02:14 +0000 2018	there is no limit to what noko can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce &amp; engagement w/ the world. chairman kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security &amp; prosperity for his citizens! 
Wed Jun 13 00:11:43 +0000 2018	i want to thank chairman kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. our unprecedented meeting – the first between an american president and a leader of north korea – proves that real change is possible! 
Wed Jun 13 00:27:36 +0000 2018	the world has taken a big step back from potential nuclear catastrophe! no more rocket launches, nuclear testing or research! the hostages are back home with their families. thank you to chairman kim, our day together was historic!
Wed Jun 13 01:14:14 +0000 2018	a year ago the pundits &amp; talking heads, people that couldn’t do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace - “please meet, don’t go to war.” now that we meet and have a great relationship with kim jong un, the same haters shout out, “you shouldn’t meet, do not meet!”
Wed Jun 13 09:37:03 +0000 2018	my political representatives didn’t want me to get involved in the mark sanford primary thinking that sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left i felt that katie was such a good candidate, and sanford was so bad, i had to give it a shot. congrats to katie arrington!
Wed Jun 13 09:40:02 +0000 2018	robert de niro, a very low iq individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. i watched him last night and truly believe he may be “punch-drunk.” i guess he doesn’t...
Wed Jun 13 09:40:03 +0000 2018	...realize the economy is the best it’s ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country. wake up punchy!
Wed Jun 13 09:55:31 +0000 2018	congratulations to corey stewart for his great victory for senator from virginia. now he runs against a total stiff, tim kaine, who is weak on crime and borders, and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. don’t underestimate corey, a major chance of winning!
Wed Jun 13 09:56:57 +0000 2018	just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day i took office. there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea. meeting with kim jong un was an interesting and very positive experience. north korea has great potential for the future!
Wed Jun 13 10:01:40 +0000 2018	before taking office people were assuming that we were going to war with north korea. president obama said that north korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. no longer - sleep well tonight!
Wed Jun 13 11:10:03 +0000 2018	we save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!
Wed Jun 13 11:49:16 +0000 2018	the u.s., together with mexico and canada, just got the world cup. congratulations - a great deal of hard work!
Wed Jun 13 11:52:50 +0000 2018	oil prices are too high, opec is at it again. not good!
Wed Jun 13 13:30:49 +0000 2018	so funny to watch the fake news, especially nbc and cnn. they are fighting hard to downplay the deal with north korea. 500 days ago they would have “begged” for this deal-looked like war would break out. our country’s biggest enemy is the fake news so easily promulgated by fools!
Wed Jun 13 20:11:41 +0000 2018	senator claire mccaskill of the great state of missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her rv tour of the state. rv’s are not for her. people are really upset, so phony! josh hawley should win big, and has my full endorsement.
Wed Jun 13 20:17:00 +0000 2018	congratulations to danny tarkanian on his big gop primary win in nevada. danny worked hard an got a great result. looking good in november!
Wed Jun 13 20:50:20 +0000 2018	congratulations to kevincramer on his huge win in north dakota. we need kevin in the senate, and i strongly endorse him. heidi voted no on our tax cuts, and always will vote no when we need her. kevin is strong on crime &amp; borders, big on cutting taxes!
Thu Jun 14 12:34:25 +0000 2018	the republican party is starting to show very big numbers. people are starting to see what is being done. results are speaking loudly. north korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!
Thu Jun 14 15:08:44 +0000 2018	now that i am back from singapore, where we had a great result with respect to north korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt, always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crime.
Thu Jun 14 15:08:51 +0000 2018	so, the democrats make up a phony crime, collusion with the russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (comey) classified information so that a special councel will be appointed, and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news!
Thu Jun 14 15:09:12 +0000 2018	the sleazy new york democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) a.g. eric schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000. i won’t settle this case!...
Thu Jun 14 15:09:21 +0000 2018	....schneiderman, who ran the clinton campaign in new york, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.
Thu Jun 14 16:33:55 +0000 2018	happy 243rd birthday to the usarmy! thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, and dedication to the u.s.a. we love you! 
Thu Jun 14 17:34:46 +0000 2018	happy flagday 
Fri Jun 15 10:35:14 +0000 2018	fbi agent peter strzok, who headed the clinton &amp; russia investigations, texted to his lover lisa page, in the ig report, that “we’ll stop” candidate trump from becoming president. doesn’t get any lower than that!
Fri Jun 15 10:55:40 +0000 2018	the ig report is a total disaster for comey, his minions and sadly, the fbi. comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the fbi. i did a great service to the people in firing him. good instincts. christopher wray will bring it proudly back!
Fri Jun 15 11:06:28 +0000 2018	thank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the u.s.a., mexico and canada. i worked hard on this, along with a great team of talented people. we never fail, and it will be a great world cup! a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advice.
Fri Jun 15 11:45:03 +0000 2018	u.s.a. jobs numbers are the best in 44 years. if my opponent (the democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy, and jobs, would have been a disaster!
Fri Jun 15 11:50:07 +0000 2018	wow, the highest rated (by far) morning show, foxandfriends, is on the front lawn of the white house. maybe i’ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?
Fri Jun 15 11:53:57 +0000 2018	“why in the world didn’t barack obama fire this guy (comey)?” asks mark levin!
Fri Jun 15 12:03:30 +0000 2018	“donald trump was 100% right to fire james comey.” mark levin
Fri Jun 15 17:08:14 +0000 2018	the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall, end catch &amp; release, visa lottery and chain, and go to merit based immigration. go for it! win!
Fri Jun 15 17:41:10 +0000 2018	wow, what a tough sentence for paul manafort, who has represented ronald reagan, bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns. didn’t know manafort was the head of the mob. what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others? very unfair!
Fri Jun 15 17:49:38 +0000 2018	i’ve had to beat 17 very talented people including the bush dynasty, then i had to beat the clinton dynasty, and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig report...and never forget the fake news media. it never ends!
Fri Jun 15 22:03:07 +0000 2018	i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany, but the fake news media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask for! 
Fri Jun 15 22:23:44 +0000 2018	the fake news media said that i did not get along with other leaders at the g7summit in canada. they are once again, wrong! 
Fri Jun 15 22:32:18 +0000 2018	great discussions with european union commission president jean-claude juncker and eu council president donald tusk at the g7summit in canada last week. 
Sat Jun 16 13:03:57 +0000 2018	democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation, for a change! this is why we need more republicans elected in november. democrats are good at only three things, high taxes, high crime and obstruction. sad!
Sat Jun 16 13:12:14 +0000 2018	my supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. as we get stronger, so does our country. best numbers ever!
Sat Jun 16 13:56:21 +0000 2018	the ig report totally distroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, peter strzok and lisa page, who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people. it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history!
Sat Jun 16 14:01:33 +0000 2018	the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, peter strzok and lisa page, who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people. it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history!
Sun Jun 17 11:52:40 +0000 2018	chuck schumer said “the summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat.” thank you chuck, but are you sure you got that right? no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. hostages already back, hero remains coming home &amp; much more!
Sun Jun 17 11:58:01 +0000 2018	please clear up the fake news! 
Sun Jun 17 12:31:46 +0000 2018	daniel henninger of the wall street journal: “this ig report makes it clear, as did rod rosenstein’s memo, that trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing jim comey. so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.”  witch hunt!
Sun Jun 17 12:40:02 +0000 2018	funny how the fake news, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i “met.” that’s because that’s all they have to disparage! we got so much for peace in the world, &amp; more is being added in finals. even got our hostages/remains!
Sun Jun 17 12:48:43 +0000 2018	holding back the “war games” during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. also, quite provocative. can start up immediately if talks break down, which i hope will not happen!
Sun Jun 17 13:01:06 +0000 2018	the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia. they are so happy! over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions &amp; millions of lives!
Sun Jun 17 13:08:26 +0000 2018	our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been. companies doing really well, and moving back to america, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.
Sun Jun 17 13:26:28 +0000 2018	washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isn’t paying them enough. i think a really long strike would be a great idea. employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time! is wapo a registered lobbyist?
Sun Jun 17 14:54:53 +0000 2018	witch hunt! there was no russian collusion. oh, i see, there was no russian collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion. the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax. too bad they didn’t look at crooked hillary like this. double standard!
Mon Jun 18 00:25:53 +0000 2018	why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media. they are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people fake news, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn’t matter to them!
Mon Jun 18 00:42:04 +0000 2018	why was the fbi’s sick loser, peter strzok, working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry &amp; conflicted democrats, when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer lisa page, that “we’ll stop” trump from becoming president? witch hunt!
Mon Jun 18 00:49:01 +0000 2018	the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security &amp; safety. don’t wait until after the election because you are going to lose!
Mon Jun 18 01:03:52 +0000 2018	“the highest level of bias i’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” trey gowdy on the fbi’s own, peter strzok. also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller. a really sick deal, isn’t it?
Mon Jun 18 12:46:07 +0000 2018	why don’t the democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including ms-13, coming into our country illegally?
Mon Jun 18 13:02:43 +0000 2018	the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition. crime in germany is way up. big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
Mon Jun 18 13:04:28 +0000 2018	we don’t want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us!
Mon Jun 18 13:50:40 +0000 2018	children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border. it is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. not going to happen in the u.s.
Mon Jun 18 13:50:53 +0000 2018	change the laws!
Mon Jun 18 13:53:48 +0000 2018	it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime. tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration. change the laws!
Mon Jun 18 14:57:40 +0000 2018	if president obama (who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have, the fake news would have named him a national hero!
Mon Jun 18 15:27:41 +0000 2018	comey gave strozk his marching orders. mueller is comey’s best friend. witch hunt!
Tue Jun 19 13:52:06 +0000 2018	i can’t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!” inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. a rigged witch hunt!p
Tue Jun 19 13:52:07 +0000 2018	crime in germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. others countries are even worse. be smart america!
Tue Jun 19 13:52:18 +0000 2018	if you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country!
Tue Jun 19 13:52:24 +0000 2018	democrats are the problem. they don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our country, like ms-13. they can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!
Tue Jun 19 14:07:02 +0000 2018	we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally. of the 12,000 children, 10,000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions.
Tue Jun 19 14:11:51 +0000 2018	changethelaws   now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security.
Tue Jun 19 15:22:29 +0000 2018	join me tomorrow in duluth, minnesota for a maga rally! tickets:  
Tue Jun 19 17:35:39 +0000 2018	thank you nfib! nfib75 
Tue Jun 19 18:04:17 +0000 2018	i want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the southern border...it has been going on for many, many decades... 
Wed Jun 20 01:06:27 +0000 2018	homeland security secnielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country, while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete &amp; nasty laws, which force family separation. we want “heart” and security in america!
Wed Jun 20 02:17:37 +0000 2018	earlier today, flotus melania and i were honored to welcome king felipe vi and queen letizia of spain to the whitehouse! 
Wed Jun 20 02:36:54 +0000 2018	thank you housegop! 
Wed Jun 20 12:25:17 +0000 2018	the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration. our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the dems will do anything not to change them &amp; to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!
Wed Jun 20 13:41:25 +0000 2018	it’s the democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. they want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. republicans want security. but i am working on something - it never ends!
Wed Jun 20 14:00:18 +0000 2018	“fbi texts have revealed anti-trump bias.” foxnews  big news, but the fake news doesn’t want to cover. total corruption - the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam! at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!
Wed Jun 20 15:00:16 +0000 2018	more records! maga 
Wed Jun 20 17:37:42 +0000 2018	
Wed Jun 20 20:04:45 +0000 2018	had a great meeting with the house gop last night at the capitol. they applauded and laughed loudly when i mentioned my experience with mark sanford. i have never been a fan of his!
Wed Jun 20 20:34:24 +0000 2018	look what fake abc news put out. i guess they had it prepared from the 13 angry democrats leading the witch hunt! stopthebias 
Wed Jun 20 20:39:30 +0000 2018	don’t worry, the republicans, and your president, will fix it! 
Wed Jun 20 21:54:38 +0000 2018	just landed in duluth, minnesota. two events planned - looking forward to them and being with petestauber and his wonderful family!
Wed Jun 20 23:30:38 +0000 2018	so sorry, people wanting to get into the already packed arena - i love you all!

Thu Jun 21 03:24:35 +0000 2018	just returning from the great state of minnesota where we had an incredible rally with 9,000 people, and at least 10,000 who could not get in - i will return! congratulations to petestauber who is loved and respected in minnesota!
Thu Jun 21 03:51:37 +0000 2018	all-time record optimism! 
Thu Jun 21 12:12:07 +0000 2018	we shouldn’t be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the wall, hire border agents and ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.
Thu Jun 21 12:29:54 +0000 2018	the border has been a big mess and problem for many years. at some point schumer and pelosi, who are weak on crime and border security, will be forced to do a real deal, so easy, that solves this long time problem. schumer used to want border security - now he’ll take crime!
Thu Jun 21 12:38:16 +0000 2018	i will be going the columbia, south carolina, on monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters, a man who truly loves the people of south carolina, governor henry mcmaster. henry worked so hard &amp; was so loyal to me that i look forward to reciprocating!
Thu Jun 21 12:47:17 +0000 2018	henry mcmaster has done a great job as governor of south carolina. the state is booming, with jobs and new industry setting records. he is tough on crime and strong on borders, health care, the mititary and our great vets. henry has my full and complete endorsement! maga
Thu Jun 21 12:50:56 +0000 2018	last night in minnesota was incredible. what a crowd!
Thu Jun 21 13:08:33 +0000 2018	what is the purpose of the house doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by democrats in the senate, and the dems are only looking to obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the mid-terms). republicans must get rid of the stupid filibuster rule-it is killing you!
Thu Jun 21 13:52:18 +0000 2018	henry mcmaster has done a great job as governor of south carolina. the state is booming, with jobs and new industry setting records. he is tough on crime and strong on borders, healthcare, the military and our great vets. henry has my full and complete endrosement! maga
Thu Jun 21 14:38:15 +0000 2018	democrats want open borders, where anyone can come into our country, and stay. this is nancy pelosi’s dream. it won’t happen!
Thu Jun 21 17:02:40 +0000 2018	my administration is acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the southern border. loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border democrats...and that's what they are - they're extremist open border democrats.... 
Thu Jun 21 20:25:24 +0000 2018	"the real big story that affects everybody in america is the success of potus's tax cut package and what it's done for our economy...” varneyco

Thu Jun 21 21:51:07 +0000 2018	“i really don’t care, do u?” written on the back of melania’s jacket, refers to the fake news media. melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!
Thu Jun 21 22:40:07 +0000 2018	we have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of – and if we show any weakness, millions of people will journey into our country.
Thu Jun 21 23:07:53 +0000 2018	you cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including “heart,” without getting dem votes. problem is, they don’t care about security and r’s do. zero dems voted to support the goodlatte bill. they won’t vote for anything!
Fri Jun 22 10:41:35 +0000 2018	our great judge jeanine pirro is out with a new book, “liars, leakers and liberals, the case against the anti-trump conspiracy,” which is fantastic. go get it!
Fri Jun 22 10:54:51 +0000 2018	even if we get 100% republican votes in the senate, we need 10 democrat votes to get a much needed immigration bill - &amp; the dems are obstructionists who won’t give votes for political reasons &amp; because they don’t care about crime coming from border! so we need to elect more r’s!
Fri Jun 22 11:00:36 +0000 2018	elect more republicans in  november and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive immigration bills anywhere in the world. right now we have the dumbest and the worst. dems are doing nothing but obstructing. remember their motto, resist! ours is produce!
Fri Jun 22 11:06:30 +0000 2018	republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in november. dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. we can pass great legislation after the red wave!
Fri Jun 22 11:31:29 +0000 2018	governor henry mcmaster is a truly fine man who loves the people of south carolina. he was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a big south carolina victory. i will see you all in s.c on monday and vice president pence will be there for henry on saturday!
Fri Jun 22 11:46:12 +0000 2018	congresswoman martha roby of alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our make america great again agenda. she is in a republican primary run-off against a recent nancy pelosi voting democrat. i fully endorse martha for alabama 2nd congressional district!
Fri Jun 22 11:58:43 +0000 2018	congressman ron desantis, a top student at yale and harvard law school, is running for governor of the great state of florida. ron is strong on borders, tough on crime &amp; big on cutting taxes - loves our military &amp; our vets. he will be a great governor &amp; has my full endorsement!
Fri Jun 22 13:30:54 +0000 2018	80% of mexico’s exports come to the united states. they totally rely on us, which is fine with me. they do have, though, very strong immigration laws. the u.s. has pathetically weak and ineffective immigration laws that the democrats refuse to help us fix. will speak to mexico!
Fri Jun 22 13:43:06 +0000 2018	we must maintain a strong southern border. we cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!
Fri Jun 22 14:10:07 +0000 2018	hope opec will increase output substantially. need to keep prices down!

Mon Jun 25 11:41:25 +0000 2018	the red hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like sarah huckabee sanders. i always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!
Mon Jun 25 12:02:21 +0000 2018	i have tried to stay uninvolved with the department of justice and fbi (although i do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive witch hunt currently going on. but you do have to ask why the doj &amp; fbi aren’t giving over requested documents?

Mon Jun 25 12:43:00 +0000 2018	hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the u.s. illegally. children brought back to their country......
Mon Jun 25 12:54:25 +0000 2018	....if this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it’s tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost. this is the only real answer - and we must continue to build the wall!

Mon Jun 25 23:30:34 +0000 2018	the hearing of peter strzok and the other hating frauds at the fbi &amp; doj should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. we should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!

Tue Jun 26 11:16:36 +0000 2018	early this year harley-davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in kansas city to thailand. that was long before tariffs were announced. hence, they were just using tariffs/trade war as an excuse. shows how unbalanced &amp; unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....
Tue Jun 26 11:25:01 +0000 2018	....we are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. we are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. they must play fair or they will pay tariffs!
Tue Jun 26 11:37:51 +0000 2018	....when i had harley-davidson officials over to the white house, i chided them about tariffs in other countries, like india, being too high. companies are now coming back to america. harley must know that they won’t be able to sell back into u.s. without paying a big tax!
Tue Jun 26 11:49:57 +0000 2018	....we are finishing our study of tariffs on cars from the e.u. in that they have long taken advantage of the u.s. in the form of trade barriers and tariffs. in the end it will all even out - and it won’t take very long!

Wed Jun 27 02:47:23 +0000 2018	the democrats are in turmoil! open borders and unchecked crime a certain way to lose elections. republicans are for strong borders, no crime! a big night!

Wed Jun 27 12:39:56 +0000 2018	house republicans should pass the strong but fair immigration bill, known as goodlatte ii, in their afternoon vote today, even though the dems won’t let it pass in the senate. passage will show that we want strong borders &amp; security while the dems want open borders = crime.  win!
Wed Jun 27 14:11:05 +0000 2018	supreme court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the union deciding for them. big loss for the coffers of the democrats!
Wed Jun 27 15:26:24 +0000 2018	harley-davidson should stay 100% in america, with the people that got you your success. i’ve done so much for you, and then this. other companies are coming back where they belong! we won’t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very happy competitors!

Thu Jun 28 11:02:01 +0000 2018	lover fbi agent peter strzok was given poor marks on yesterday’s closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. there was no collusion and the witch hunt, headed by 13 angry democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is rigged!
Thu Jun 28 11:25:15 +0000 2018	russia continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling in our election! where is the dnc server, and why didn’t shady james comey and the now disgraced fbi agents take and closely examine it? why isn’t hillary/russia being looked at? so many questions, so much corruption!

Thu Jun 28 12:30:31 +0000 2018	peter strzok worked as the leader of the rigged witch hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. but remember, he took his orders from comey and mccabe and they took their orders from you know who. mueller/comey best friends!

Sat Jun 30 11:07:30 +0000 2018	the democrats are making a strong push to abolish ice, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that i have ever seen. i have watched ice liberate towns from the grasp of ms-13 &amp; clean out the toughest of situations. they are great!

Sat Jun 30 19:17:42 +0000 2018	i never pushed the republicans in the house to vote for the immigration bill, either goodlatte 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. i released many prior to the vote knowing we need more republicans to win in nov.
Sat Jun 30 19:26:12 +0000 2018	either we need to elect more republicans in november or republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both. cryin’ chuck would do it on day one, but we’ll never give him the chance. some great legislation awaits - be smart!

Tue Jul 03 02:43:57 +0000 2018	many democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their “leadership” wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ice, thereby declaring war on law &amp; order. these people will be voting for republicans in november and, in many cases, joining the republican party!
Tue Jul 03 10:16:51 +0000 2018	crazy maxine waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with nancy pelosi, the face of the democrat party. her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the democrats!

Tue Jul 03 10:49:10 +0000 2018	when we have an “infestation” of ms-13 gangs in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ice! they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. dems do not appreciate the great job they do! nov.
Tue Jul 03 10:57:52 +0000 2018	how can the democrats, who are weak on the border and weak on crime, do well in november. the people of our country want and demand safety and security, while the democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great law enforcement!
Tue Jul 03 11:16:18 +0000 2018	many good conversations with north korea-it is going well! in the meantime, no rocket launches or nuclear testing in 8 months. all of asia is thrilled. only the opposition party, which includes the fake news, is complaining. if not for me, we would now be at war with north korea!

Tue Jul 03 21:19:04 +0000 2018	after having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. i capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!

Tue Jul 03 23:13:34 +0000 2018	after having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. i capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!
Tue Jul 03 23:19:35 +0000 2018	thank you, wvgovernor jim justice, for that warm introduction. tonight, it was my great honor to attend the “greenbrier classic – salute to service dinner” in west virginia! god bless our veterans. god bless america - and happy independence day to all!

Wed Jul 04 00:36:39 +0000 2018	tomorrow, families across our nation will gather to celebrate the fourth of july. as we do, we will think of the men &amp; women serving overseas at this very moment, far away from their families, protecting america - &amp; we will thank god for blessing us with these incredible heroes!

Wed Jul 04 20:46:00 +0000 2018	the opec monopoly must remember that gas prices are up &amp; they are doing little to help. if anything, they are driving prices higher as the united states defends many of their members for very little $’s. this must be a two way street. reduce pricing now!
Thu Jul 05 02:47:35 +0000 2018	happy birthday, america! 
Thu Jul 05 14:08:57 +0000 2018	congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable immigration laws now. law enforcement at the border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. when people, with or without children, enter our country, they must be told to leave without our........
Thu Jul 05 14:16:07 +0000 2018	.....country being forced to endure a long and costly trial. tell the people “out,” and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. hiring thousands of “judges” does not work and is not acceptable - only country in the world that does this!
Thu Jul 05 14:17:23 +0000 2018	congress - fix our insane immigration laws now!
Thu Jul 05 19:37:57 +0000 2018	i have accepted the resignation of scott pruitt as the administrator of the environmental protection agency. within the agency scott has done an outstanding job, and i will always be thankful to him for this. the senate confirmed deputy at epa, andrew wheeler, will...

Fri Jul 06 00:44:17 +0000 2018	a vote for democrats in november is a vote to let ms-13 run wild in our communities, to let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking americans. democrats want anarchy, amnesty and chaos - republicans want law, order and justice!
Fri Jul 06 00:58:50 +0000 2018	every day, the brave men and women of ice are liberating communities from savage gangs like ms-13. we will not stand for these vile democrat smears in law enforcement. we will always stand proudly with the brave heroes of ice and border patrol!
Fri Jul 06 01:06:36 +0000 2018	thanks to republican leadership, america is winning again - and america is being respected again all over the world. because we are finally putting america first!

Fri Jul 06 16:57:34 +0000 2018	just won lawsuit filed by the dnc and a bunch of democrat crazies trying to claim the trump campaign (and others), colluded with russia. they haven’t figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!
Sat Jul 07 13:21:11 +0000 2018	twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. will that include the failing new york times and propaganda machine for amazon, the washington post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my opinion, don’t exist - they will both be out of business in 7 years!
Sat Jul 07 13:24:41 +0000 2018	big decision will soon be made on our next justice of the supreme court!
Sat Jul 07 20:29:34 +0000 2018	public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the “special” councel because the public understands that there was no  collusion with russia (so ridiculous), that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation &amp; that the only collusion was with the dems!
Sat Jul 07 20:42:48 +0000 2018	public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the “special” counsel because the public understands that there was no  collusion with russia (so ridiculous), that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation &amp; that the only collusion was with the dems!
Sat Jul 07 22:24:02 +0000 2018	the rigged witch hunt, originally headed by fbi lover boy peter s (for one year) &amp; now, 13 angry democrats, should look into the missing dnc server, crooked hillary’s illegally deleted emails, the pakistani fraudster, uranium one, podesta &amp; so much more. it’s a democrat con job!
Sun Jul 08 13:14:13 +0000 2018	the u.s. is working very closely with the government of thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. very brave and talented people!

Sun Jul 08 21:58:52 +0000 2018	they just didn't get it, but they do now! 
Mon Jul 09 11:55:01 +0000 2018	the united states is spending far more on nato than any other country. this is not fair, nor is it acceptable. while these countries have been increasing their contributions since i took office, they must do much more. germany is at 1%, the u.s. is at 4%, and nato benefits.......
Mon Jul 09 12:04:02 +0000 2018	...europe far more than it does the u.s. by some accounts, the u.s. is paying for 90% of nato, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. on top of this the european union has a trade surplus of $151 million with the u.s., with big trade barriers on u.s. goods. no!
Mon Jul 09 12:14:43 +0000 2018	i have long heard that the most important decision a u.s. president can make is the selection of a supreme court justice - will be announced tonight at 9:00 p.m.
Mon Jul 09 14:25:06 +0000 2018	i have confidence that kim jong un will honor the contract we signed &amp;, even more importantly, our handshake. we agreed to the denuclearization of north korea. china, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on chinese trade-hope not!
Mon Jul 09 17:04:04 +0000 2018	the failing ny times fake news story today about breast feeding must be called out. the u.s. strongly supports breast feeding but we don’t believe women should be denied access to formula. many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.
Mon Jul 09 17:08:29 +0000 2018	pfizer &amp; others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. they are merely taking advantage of the poor &amp; others unable to defend themselves, while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in europe &amp; elsewhere. we will respond!
Mon Jul 09 22:22:40 +0000 2018	happy 100th birthday to our amazing current and former army warrant officers. thank you for your century of service, as the indispensable guardians of our great usarmy’s technology! centuryofservice 
Tue Jul 10 02:54:10 +0000 2018	tonight, it was my honor and privilege to nominate judge brett kavanaugh to the united states supreme court. scotus 
Tue Jul 10 09:35:05 +0000 2018	getting ready to leave for europe. first meeting - nato. the u.s. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. not fair to the u.s. taxpayer. on top of that we lose $151 billion on trade with the european union. charge us big tariffs (&amp; barriers)!
Tue Jul 10 10:42:43 +0000 2018	nato countries must pay more, the united states must pay less. very unfair!
Tue Jul 10 10:59:30 +0000 2018	thank you to all of my great supporters, really big progress being made. other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. economy is roaring. supreme court pick getting great reviews. new poll says trump, at over 90%, is the most popular republican in history of the party. wow!
Tue Jul 10 12:39:18 +0000 2018	on behalf of the united states, congratulations to the thai navy seals and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in thailand. such a beautiful moment - all freed, great job!
Tue Jul 10 14:40:12 +0000 2018	i am on air force one flying to nato and hear reports that the fbi lovers, peter strzok and lisa page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the rigged witch hunt headed by 13 angry democrats and people that worked for obama for 8 years. total disgrace!

Tue Jul 10 17:01:30 +0000 2018	many countries in nato, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. will they reimburse the u.s.?
Tue Jul 10 18:42:21 +0000 2018	a recent emerson college epoll said that most americans, especially hispanics, feel that they are better off under president trump than they were under president obama.
Tue Jul 10 18:52:21 +0000 2018	the european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe (u.s. has a $151 billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through nato, and nicely pay for it. just doesn’t work!
Tue Jul 10 22:37:28 +0000 2018	just talked with pfizer ceo and secazar on our drug pricing blueprint. pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so american patients don’t pay more. we applaud pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. great news for the american people!
Wed Jul 11 08:04:45 +0000 2018	bilateral breakfast with nato secretary general in brussels, belgium... 
Wed Jul 11 12:40:31 +0000 2018	i am in brussels, but always thinking about our farmers. soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. farmers have done poorly for 15 years. other countries’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. i will open...
Wed Jul 11 12:40:32 +0000 2018	...things up, better than ever before, but it can’t go too quickly. i am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!
Wed Jul 11 16:41:12 +0000 2018	democrats in congress must no longer obstruct - vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now. i am watching what is going on from europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. they are just using children!
Wed Jul 11 16:50:49 +0000 2018	what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? the u.s. is paying for europe’s protection, then loses billions on trade. must pay 2% of gdp immediately, not by 2025.

Wed Jul 11 21:09:01 +0000 2018	if the democrats want to win supreme court and other court picks, don’t obstruct and resist, but rather do it the good ol’ fashioned way, win elections!
Wed Jul 11 21:53:26 +0000 2018	ex-fbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress! wow, but is anybody really surprised!  together with her lover, fbi agent peter strzok, she worked on the rigged witch hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever!
Wed Jul 11 22:47:16 +0000 2018	how can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former fbi agent/lover peter strzok? read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clear!
Wed Jul 11 23:33:33 +0000 2018	billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn’t nearly enough. u.s. spends too much. europe’s borders are bad! pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable!
Thu Jul 12 05:55:24 +0000 2018	as i head out to a very important nato meeting, i see that fbi lover/agent lisa page is dodging a subpoena &amp; is refusing to show up and testify. what can she possibly say about her statements and lies. so much corruption on the other side. where is the attorney general? foxnews
Thu Jul 12 06:03:29 +0000 2018	presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia. they pay only a fraction of their cost. the u.s. pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe, and loses big on trade!
Thu Jul 12 06:12:05 +0000 2018	....on top of it all, germany just started paying russia, the country they want protection from, billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia. not acceptable! all nato nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!

Thu Jul 12 15:10:51 +0000 2018	“trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment. in june, for instance, the unemployment rate for hispanics and latinos 16 years and older fell to 4.6%, its lowest level ever, from 4.9% in may.”

Sat Jul 14 09:46:55 +0000 2018	the stock market hit 25,000 yesterday. jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. it is all happening!
Sat Jul 14 09:53:13 +0000 2018	the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration, not the trump administrations. why didn’t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september, before the election?
Sat Jul 14 09:57:53 +0000 2018	....where is the dnc server, and why didn’t the fbi take possession of it? deep state?

Sat Jul 14 11:24:13 +0000 2018	so funny! i just checked out fake news cnn, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of jim acosta (actually a nice guy). they didn’t! but they did say i already lost in my meeting with putin. fake news......
Sat Jul 14 11:34:32 +0000 2018	....remember, it was little jeff z and his people, who are told exactly what to say, who said i could not win the election in that “there was no way to 270” (over &amp; over again) in the electoral college. i got 306! they were sooooo wrong in their election coverage. still hurting!
Sat Jul 14 12:44:05 +0000 2018	our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in japan. we commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones. 
Sat Jul 14 18:17:37 +0000 2018	these russian individuals did their work during the obama years. why didn’t obama do something about it?  because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win, that’s why. had nothing to do with the trump administration, but fake news doesn’t want to report the truth, as usual!
Sun Jul 15 16:11:13 +0000 2018	there hasn’t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in north korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn’t the fake news talking about these wonderful facts? because it is fake news!
Sun Jul 15 16:18:10 +0000 2018	heading to helsinki, finland – looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow. unfortunately, no matter how well i do at the summit, if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia...
Sun Jul 15 16:18:11 +0000 2018	...over the years, i would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition! much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the dems...
Sun Jul 15 16:18:12 +0000 2018	...know how to do is resist and obstruct! this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country – but at some point, it will heal!
Sun Jul 15 17:03:03 +0000 2018	congratulations to france, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 world cup. additionally, congratulations to president putin and russia for putting on a truly great world cup tournament -- one of the best ever!
Mon Jul 16 05:23:50 +0000 2018	received many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present &amp; future. we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. nato is now strong &amp; rich!
Mon Jul 16 05:37:05 +0000 2018	president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, &amp; did nothing about it. when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok!
Mon Jul 16 06:05:29 +0000 2018	our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of u.s. foolishness and stupidity and now, the rigged witch hunt!
Mon Jul 16 08:56:58 +0000 2018	it was an honor to join you this morning. thank you!

Tue Jul 17 12:59:36 +0000 2018	thank you randpaul, you really get it! “the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed think?”
Tue Jul 17 13:53:39 +0000 2018	i had a great meeting with nato. they have paid $33 billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future, only because of me. nato was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for russia). the media only says i was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!
Tue Jul 17 14:22:28 +0000 2018	while i had a great meeting with nato, raising vast amounts of money, i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia. sadly, it is not being reported that way - the fake news is going crazy!
Tue Jul 17 14:33:47 +0000 2018	thank you randpaul. “the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed to think?”
Tue Jul 17 14:39:08 +0000 2018	the economy of the united states is stronger than ever before!
Wed Jul 18 00:21:54 +0000 2018	the meeting between president putin and myself was a great success, except in the fake news media!
Wed Jul 18 00:27:37 +0000 2018	the democrats want to abolish ice, which will mean more crime in our country. i want to give ice a big cheer! vote republican in november.
Wed Jul 18 04:10:19 +0000 2018	“prosperity is returning. donald trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate, now as the most effective president, the most successful president, in modern american history.” thank you to the great lou dobbs!
Wed Jul 18 09:53:41 +0000 2018	so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki. putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. big results will come!
Wed Jul 18 10:08:36 +0000 2018	while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. many positive things will come out of that meeting..
Wed Jul 18 10:16:50 +0000 2018	....russia has agreed to help with north korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. there is no rush, the sanctions remain! big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process!
Wed Jul 18 10:44:18 +0000 2018	congratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress. my endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the “flood gates” opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. enjoy!
Wed Jul 18 11:03:05 +0000 2018	“a lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.”  foxandfriends  kilmeade
Wed Jul 18 11:27:59 +0000 2018	some people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia. they would rather go to war than see this. it’s called trump derangement syndrome!
Wed Jul 18 11:33:34 +0000 2018	3.4 million jobs created since our great election victory - far greater than ever anticipated, and only getting better as new and greatly improved trade deals start coming to fruition!
Wed Jul 18 19:25:30 +0000 2018	brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia. the primary is on tuesday. brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment. i give him my full and total endorsement.
Wed Jul 18 21:29:06 +0000 2018	thank you to congressman kevin yoder! he secured $5 billion for border security. now we need congress to support. kevin has been strong on crime, the border, the 2nd amendment, and he loves our military and vets. repkevinyoder has my full and total endorsement!
Wed Jul 18 21:30:19 +0000 2018	the two biggest opponents of ice in america today are the democratic party and ms-13!
Thu Jul 19 01:35:33 +0000 2018	a total disgrace that turkey will not release a respected u.s. pastor, andrew brunson, from prison. he has been held hostage far too long. rt_erdogan should do something to free this wonderful christian husband &amp; father. he has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him!
Thu Jul 19 10:23:14 +0000 2018	thank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. likewise to pfizer. we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs.
Thu Jul 19 10:29:15 +0000 2018	the democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ice. this should cost them heavily in the midterms. yesterday, the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ice!
Thu Jul 19 10:37:57 +0000 2018	the fake news media is going crazy! they make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. but i’ll complain anyway!
Thu Jul 19 10:59:26 +0000 2018	the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that i’ll probably have a good relationship with putin. we are doing much better than any other country!
Thu Jul 19 11:13:48 +0000 2018	“trump recognized russian meddling many times.” thank you to foxandfriends and foxnews for actually showing the clips. the fake news wants no part of that narrative! too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set.
Thu Jul 19 11:37:25 +0000 2018	really big jobs meeting today at the white house! 3 p.m.
Thu Jul 19 13:11:17 +0000 2018	i told you so! the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies, google. they truly have taken advantage of the u.s., but not for long!
Thu Jul 19 13:24:58 +0000 2018	the summit with russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the fake news media. i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for israel, nuclear........
Thu Jul 19 13:27:03 +0000 2018	“trump recognized russian meddling many times.” 
Thu Jul 19 13:30:11 +0000 2018	....proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, ukraine, middle east peace, north korea and more. there are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can all be solved!
Thu Jul 19 13:35:21 +0000 2018	“trump recognized russian meddling many times” 
Thu Jul 19 18:14:25 +0000 2018	will the dems and fake news ever learn? this is classic! 
Fri Jul 20 12:31:18 +0000 2018	my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri. such a tragedy, such a great loss. may god be with you all!
Fri Jul 20 12:43:05 +0000 2018	china, the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the u.s. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. as usual, not a level playing field...
Fri Jul 20 12:51:45 +0000 2018	....the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well. tightening now hurts all that we have done. the u.s. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals. debt coming due &amp; we are raising rates - really?
Fri Jul 20 13:04:44 +0000 2018	farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. the price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the election. a big reason is bad (terrible) trade deals with other countries. they put on massive tariffs and barriers. canada charges 275% on dairy. farmers will win!
Fri Jul 20 14:35:49 +0000 2018	so important. should have been done years ago! 
Fri Jul 20 21:50:30 +0000 2018	i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin. in the old days they would call it diplomacy. if i was loud &amp; vicious, i would have been criticized for being too tough. remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim? hypocrites!
Fri Jul 20 22:17:21 +0000 2018	the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again - can’t believe it! isn’t it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? the $40,000,000 commissioner must now make a stand. first time kneeling, out for game. second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!
Sat Jul 21 12:10:58 +0000 2018	inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of &amp; perhaps illegal. the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong!
Sat Jul 21 22:40:06 +0000 2018	the rigged witch hunt, headed by the 13 angry democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for obama w.h.), seems intent on damaging the republican party’s chances in the november election. this democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 election never ends!
Sat Jul 21 22:50:38 +0000 2018	no collusion, no obstruction - but that doesn’t matter because the 13 angry democrats, who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats, want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election. republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!
Sat Jul 21 23:00:42 +0000 2018	brian kemp, who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement, is campaigning tonight with mikepencevp. brian is very strong on crime and borders, loves our military, vets and the 2nd amendment. he will be a great governor!

Sat Jul 21 23:23:34 +0000 2018	troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on crime &amp; borders. troy is the total opposite, and loves our military, vets &amp; 2nd amendment. early voting just started with election day on august 7th. troy has my full &amp; total endorsement!
Sun Jul 22 00:21:01 +0000 2018	watching los angeles possible hostage situation very closely. active barricaded suspect. l.a.p.d. working with federal law enforcement.
Sun Jul 22 10:28:40 +0000 2018	congratulations to judicialwatch and tomfitton on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents. as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of “justice” and fbi misled the courts. witch hunt rigged, a scam!
Sun Jul 22 10:49:25 +0000 2018	looking more &amp; more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc. ask her how that worked out - she did better with crazy bernie. republicans must get tough now. an illegal scam!
Sun Jul 22 12:22:49 +0000 2018	andrew mccarthy - “i said this could never happen. this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. it is so bad it screams out at you.”  on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt!
Sun Jul 22 12:56:15 +0000 2018	.petehegseth on foxnews  “source 1 was the (fake) dossier. yes, the dirty dossier, paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump, and looking for information that could discredit candidate 1 trump. carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign...” illegal!
Sun Jul 22 13:15:18 +0000 2018	i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. so bad for our country!
Sun Jul 22 20:58:44 +0000 2018	happy birthday senatordole! 
Sun Jul 22 22:23:52 +0000 2018	so president obama knew about russia before the election. why didn’t he do something about it? why didn’t he tell our campaign? because it is all a big hoax, that’s why, and he thought crooked hillary was going to win!!!
Mon Jul 23 03:24:19 +0000 2018	to iranian president rouhani: never, ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence &amp; death. be cautious!
Mon Jul 23 10:13:52 +0000 2018	tom fitton on foxandfriends at 6:15 a.m. now! judicial watch.
Mon Jul 23 10:30:11 +0000 2018	so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier, that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc, that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt!
Mon Jul 23 10:52:10 +0000 2018	“it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team. this is a clinton campaign document. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump....
Mon Jul 23 11:01:15 +0000 2018	....and the doj, fbi and obama gang need to be held to account. source 1 was the major source. avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it. misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team. not about carter page..was all about getting trump.....
Mon Jul 23 11:09:39 +0000 2018	.....”carter page wasn’t a spy, wasn’t an agent of the russians - he would have cooperated with the fbi. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump.” tom fitton judicialwatch a disgrace to america. they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now!
Mon Jul 23 12:25:02 +0000 2018	when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin, and all that i gave up, remember, i gave up nothing, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the corrupt media!
Mon Jul 23 13:06:18 +0000 2018	a rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months. likewise, no nuclear tests. japan is happy, all of asia is happy. but the fake news is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that i am angry because it is not going fast enough. wrong, very happy!
Mon Jul 23 13:21:15 +0000 2018	the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the u.s. supreme court two months ago. next up is the u.s. post office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their “delivery boy” for a big percentage of their packages....
Mon Jul 23 13:35:20 +0000 2018	....in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for amazon. is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?
Tue Jul 24 01:35:37 +0000 2018	robert will do a great job for our vets. we also recently won choice! 
Tue Jul 24 01:44:06 +0000 2018	lou barletta was one of my first supporters. he is tough on crime and borders. will be a great senator from pennsylvania. his opponent is weak on crime, ice and borders. we need lou!

Tue Jul 24 11:09:12 +0000 2018	countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate. this should have taken place many years ago but, as the saying goes, better late than never!
Tue Jul 24 11:29:50 +0000 2018	tariffs are the greatest! either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with tariffs. it’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! remember, we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed. all will be great!
Tue Jul 24 13:39:49 +0000 2018	today is the day to vote for brian kemp. will be great for georgia, full endorsement!

Tue Jul 24 15:50:37 +0000 2018	i’m very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election. based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the democrats. they definitely don’t want trump!
Tue Jul 24 17:51:28 +0000 2018	vfwconvention vfwhq 
Tue Jul 24 19:15:36 +0000 2018	i want to thank the vfwhq for your devotion to our fallen heroes, unknown soldiers, prisoners of war, those missing in action, and their families. vfwconvention

Wed Jul 25 00:08:01 +0000 2018	the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade. i have an idea for them. both the u.s. and the e.u. drop all tariffs, barriers and subsidies! that would finally be called free market and fair trade! hope they do it, we are ready - but they won’t!
Wed Jul 25 00:39:16 +0000 2018	so sad and unfair that the fcc wouldn’t approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune. this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people. liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not sinclair. disgraceful!
Wed Jul 25 01:05:05 +0000 2018	“the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton &amp; frame donald trump” is a hot seller, already number one! more importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly. congratulations to gregg jarrett!
Wed Jul 25 11:01:05 +0000 2018	every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs, i wonder, what can they be thinking? are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  lost $817 billion on trade last year. no weakness!
Wed Jul 25 11:08:39 +0000 2018	when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. negotiations are going really well, be cool. the end result will be worth it!
Wed Jul 25 11:20:28 +0000 2018	china is targeting our farmers, who they know i love &amp; respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the u.s. they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. we were being nice - until now! china made $517 billion on us last year.
Wed Jul 25 12:34:58 +0000 2018	what kind of a lawyer would tape a client? so sad! is this a first, never heard of it before? why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while i was presumably saying positive things? i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? too bad!
Wed Jul 25 12:41:14 +0000 2018	congratulations to brian kemp on your very big win in georgia last night. wow, 69-30, those are big numbers. now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you. she is weak on vets, the military and the 2nd amendment. win!
Wed Jul 25 20:57:24 +0000 2018	the united states and the european union have a $1 trillion bilateral trade relationship – the largest economic relationship in the world. we want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all american and european citizens... 
Wed Jul 25 22:33:01 +0000 2018	this week, my administration is hosting the first-ever irfministerial. the u.s. will continue to promote religiousfreedom around the world. nations that support religious freedom are far more free, prosperous &amp; peaceful. great job, vp, secpompeo, irf_ambassador &amp; statedept!
Wed Jul 25 22:45:49 +0000 2018	sergio marchionne, who passed away today, was one of the most brilliant &amp; successful car executives since the days of the legendary henry ford. it was a great honor for me to get to know sergio as potus, he loved the car industry, and fought hard for it. he will be truly missed!
Wed Jul 25 22:59:35 +0000 2018	thank you very much, working hard! 
Wed Jul 25 23:42:23 +0000 2018	great meeting on trade today with junckereu and representatives of the european union. we have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs, no barriers and no subsidies. work on documents has already started and the process is moving...
Wed Jul 25 23:42:24 +0000 2018	...along quickly. european union nations will be open to the united states and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them. there was great warmth and feeling in the room - a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible!
Wed Jul 25 23:49:34 +0000 2018	obviously the european union, as represented by junckereu and the united states, as represented by yours truly, love each other! 
Thu Jul 26 00:16:32 +0000 2018	thank you georgia! they say that my endorsement last week of brian kemp, in the republican primary for governor against a very worthy opponent, lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! two very good and talented men in a great race, but congratulations to brian!
Thu Jul 26 01:01:08 +0000 2018	great to be back on track with the european union. this was a big day for free and fair trade!
Thu Jul 26 01:07:28 +0000 2018	european union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. also, they will be buying vast amounts of lng!
Thu Jul 26 11:46:09 +0000 2018	twitter “shadow banning” prominent republicans. not good. we will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! many complaints.

Thu Jul 26 15:22:39 +0000 2018	the united states will impose large sanctions on turkey for their long time detainment of pastor andrew brunson, a great christian, family man and wonderful human being. he is suffering greatly. this innocent man of faith should be released immediately!

Thu Jul 26 22:48:38 +0000 2018	.alandersh, a brilliant lawyer, who although a liberal democrat who probably didn’t vote for me, has discussed the witch hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way. he has written a new and very important book...
Thu Jul 26 22:48:40 +0000 2018	...called “the case against impeaching trump,” which i would encourage all people with trump derangement syndrome to read!

Fri Jul 27 11:26:20 +0000 2018	arrived back in washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major u.s. steel plant in granite city, illinois, only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted robert mueller and his gang of 13 angry democrats obviously cannot find collusion...
Fri Jul 27 11:38:32 +0000 2018	....,the only collusion with russia was with the democrats, so now they are looking at my tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged witch hunt continues! how stupid and unfair to our country....and so the fake news doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions, no,....
Fri Jul 27 11:56:15 +0000 2018	.....i did not know of the meeting with my son, don jr. sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (taxi cabs maybe?). he even retained bill and crooked hillary’s lawyer. gee, i wonder if they helped him make the choice!
Fri Jul 27 13:17:09 +0000 2018	great gdp numbers just released. will be having a news conference soon!

Fri Jul 27 18:16:46 +0000 2018	the usnavy’s first female admiral, alene duerk once said: “it was a nice distinction to have, and to be recognized as the first, but i wanted to make certain that i used that notoriety to do as much positive as i could.” alene did just that, and america is forever grateful!

Fri Jul 27 22:45:56 +0000 2018	democrats, who want open borders and care little about crime, are incompetent, but they have the fake news media almost totally on their side!
Sat Jul 28 00:47:58 +0000 2018	the only things the democrats do well is “resist,” which is their campaign slogan, and “obstruct.” cryin’ chuck schumer has almost 400 great american people that are waiting “forever” to serve our country! a total disgrace. mitch m should not let them go home until all approved!
Sat Jul 28 01:53:48 +0000 2018	join me in tampa, florida next tuesday, july 31st at 7:00pme for a maga rally! tickets:

Sun Jul 29 11:31:52 +0000 2018	tom homan, fmr ice director: “there is nobody that has done more for border security &amp; public safety than president trump. i’ve worked for six presidents, and i respect them all, but nobody has done more than this administration &amp; president trump, that’s just a stone cold fact!”
Sun Jul 29 11:44:00 +0000 2018	wow, highest poll numbers in the history of the republican party. that includes honest abe lincoln and ronald reagan. there must be something wrong, please recheck that poll!
Sun Jul 29 11:52:49 +0000 2018	do you think the fake news media will ever report on this tweet from michael? 
Sun Jul 29 11:58:09 +0000 2018	please understand, there are consequences when people cross our border illegally, whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. congress must act on fixing the dumbest &amp; worst immigration laws anywhere in the world! vote “r”
Sun Jul 29 12:30:04 +0000 2018	had a very good and interesting meeting at the white house with a.g. sulzberger, publisher of the new york times. spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media &amp; how that fake news has morphed into phrase, “enemy of the people.” sad!
Sun Jul 29 12:42:52 +0000 2018	the biggest and best results coming out of the good gdp report was that the quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by $52 billion and, of course, the historically low unemployment numbers, especially for african americans, hispanics, asians and women.
Sun Jul 29 13:13:59 +0000 2018	i would be willing to “shut down” government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security, which includes the wall! must get rid of lottery, catch &amp; release etc. and finally go to system of immigration based on merit! we need great people coming into our country!
Sun Jul 29 19:09:17 +0000 2018	when the media - driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it  truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk! very unpatriotic! freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news...
Sun Jul 29 19:09:18 +0000 2018	...accurately. 90% of media coverage of my administration is negative, despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving, it’s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low! i will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-trump haters in the...
Sun Jul 29 19:09:18 +0000 2018	...dying newspaper industry. no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people! as an example, the failing new york times...
Sun Jul 29 19:09:19 +0000 2018	...and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change!
Sun Jul 29 19:35:14 +0000 2018	there is no collusion! the robert mueller rigged witch hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an obama white house lawyer) angry democrats, was started by a fraudulent dossier, paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc. therefore, the witch hunt is an illegal scam!

Sun Aug 19 11:15:12 +0000 2018	....and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close. so many lives have been ruined over nothing - mccarthyism at its worst! yet mueller &amp; his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - media is even worse!
Sun Aug 19 11:30:41 +0000 2018	no collusion and no obstruction, except by crooked hillary and the democrats. all of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction. what about the brennan, comey, mccabe, strzok lies to congress, or crooked’s emails!
Sun Aug 19 12:06:43 +0000 2018	the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president, when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp; the two fake reporters knew this. this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people. so bad for america!

Mon Aug 20 14:13:19 +0000 2018	i hope john brennan, the worst cia director in our country’s history, brings a lawsuit. it will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt. he won’t sue!
Mon Aug 20 14:23:57 +0000 2018	everybody wants to keep their security clearance, it’s worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan. it certainly isn’t because of the good job he did! he is a political “hack.”
