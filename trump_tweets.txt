join me live from the whitehouse. 
hope you like my nomination of judge neil gorsuch for the united states supreme court. he is a good and brilliant man, respected by all.
everybody is arguing whether or not it is a ban. call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!
iran is rapidly taking over more and more of iraq even after the u.s. has squandered three trillion dollars there. obvious long ago!
do you believe it? the obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from australia. why? i will study this dumb deal!
if u.c. berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - no federal funds?

thank you, samsung! we would love to have you!

when a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in &amp; out, especially for reasons of safety &amp;.security - big trouble!
interesting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban. they know if certain people are allowed in it's death &amp; destruction!
the opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the fake news nytimes is still lost!
make america great again!
what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into u.s.?
because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. a terrible decision
why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
interview with oreillyfactor on fox network - 4:00 p.m. (prior to super bowl). enjoy!
the judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. bad people are very happy!

any negative polls are fake news, just like the cnn, abc, nbc polls in the election. sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.
i call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. some fake news media, in order to marginalize, lies!

the first meeting jeff sessions had with the russian amb was set up by the obama administration under education program for 100 ambs......
terrible! just found out that obama had my "wires tapped" in trump tower just before the victory. nothing found. this is mccarthyism!
just out: the same russian ambassador that met jeff sessions visited the obama white house 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
is it legal for a sitting president to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? turned down by court earlier. a new low!
i'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october, just prior to election!
how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. this is nixon/watergate. bad (or sick) guy!

james clapper and others stated that there is no evidence potus colluded with russia. this story is fake news and everyone knows it!
the democrats made up and pushed the russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. big advantage in electoral college &amp; lost!
the real story that congress, the fbi and all others should be looking into is the leaking of classified information. must find leaker now!
just heard fake news cnn is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a way off disaster. much higher ratings at fox
what about all of the contact with the clinton campaign and the russians? also, is it true that the dnc would not let the fbi in to look?

the failing nytimes finally gets it - "in places where no insurance company offers plans, there will be no way for obamacare customers to..
...use subsidies to buy health plans." in other words, ocare is dead. good things will happen, however, either with republicans or dems.
wow, foxnews just reporting big news. source: "official behind unmasking is high up. known intel official is responsible. some unmasked....

just arrived in taormina with flotus melania.  g7summit usa 
just arrived in italy for the g7. trip has been very successful. we made and saved the usa many billions of dollars and millions of jobs.
getting ready to engage g7 leaders on many issues including economic growth, terrorism, and security.
terrorists are engaged in a war against civilization- it is up to all who value life to confront &amp; defeat this evil➡️
on behalf of flotus melania and myself, thank you for a wonderful dinner and evening, president sergio mattarella.… 
big g7 meetings today. lots of very important matters under discussion. first on the list, of course, is terrorism. g7taormina
many nato countries have agreed to step up payments considerably, as they should. money is beginning to pour in- nato will be much stronger.
i will make my final decision on the paris accord next week!
just left the g7summit. had great meetings on everything, especially on trade where....
...."we push for the removal of all trade-distorting practices....to foster a truly level playing field."
i look forward to reading the commercegov 232 analysis of steel and aluminum- to be released in june. will take major action if necessary.
bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back to the u.s.a. from the middle east - which will mean jobs, jobs, jobs!
just arrived in italy after having a very successful nato meeting in brussels. told other nations they must pay more, not fair to  u.s.
big win in montana for republicans! we
big win in montana for republicans!
just returned from europe. trip was a great success for america. hard work but big results!
it is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the white house are fabricated lies made up by the fakenews media.
whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media, and they don't mention names....
....it is very possible that those sources don't exsist but are made up by fake news writers. fakenews is the enemy!
does anyone notice how the montana congressional race was such a big deal to dems &amp; fake news until the republican won? v was poorly covered
....it is very possible that those sources don't exist but are made up by fake news writers. fakenews is the enemy!
does anyone notice how the montana congressional race was such a big deal to dems &amp; fake news until the republican won? v was poorly covered
british prime minister may was very angry that the info the u.k. gave to u.s. about manchester was leaked. gave me full details!
i suggest that we add more dollars to healthcare and make it the best anywhere. obamacare is dead - the republicans will do much better!
the massive tax cuts/reform that i have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule. big benefits to all!
the fake news media works hard at disparaging &amp; demeaning my use of social media because they don't want america to hear the real story!
honoring the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to america. home of the free, because of the brave. memorialday
north korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbor, china, by shooting off yet another ballistic missile...but china is trying hard!
today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving. thank you, god bless your families &amp; god bless the usa!
i look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this memorial day at arlington national cemetery later this morning.
we have a massive trade deficit with germany, plus they pay far less than they should on nato &amp; military. very bad for u.s. this will change
russian officials must be laughing at the u.s. &amp; how a lame excuse for why the dems lost the election has taken over the fake news.
the u.s. senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get healthcare and tax cuts approved, fast and easy. dems would do it, no doubt!
despite the constant negative press covfefe
who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ???  enjoy!
so now it is reported that the democrats, who have excoriated carter page about russia, don't want him to testify. he blows away their....
...case against him &amp; now wants to clear his name by showing "the false or misleading testimony by james comey, john brennan..." witch hunt!
kathy griffin should be ashamed of herself. my children, especially my 11 year old son, barron, are having a hard time with this. sick!
hopefully republican senators, good people all, can quickly get together and pass a new (repeal &amp; replace) healthcare bill. add saved $'s.
i will be announcing my decision on the paris accord over the next few days. make america great again!
we traveled the world to strengthen long-standing alliances, and to form new partnerships. see more at:…

whatever the united states can do to help out in london and the u. k., we will be there - we are with you. god bless!

at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"
do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? that's because they used knives and a truck!
people, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but i am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban!
the justice dept. should have stayed with the original travel ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to s.c.
the justice dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the supreme court - &amp; seek much tougher version!
in any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the u.s. in order to help keep our country safe. the courts are slow and political!

the fake msm is working so hard trying to get me not to use social media. they hate that i can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
during my recent trip to the middle east i stated that there can no longer be funding of radical ideology. leaders pointed to qatar - look!

former homeland security advisor jeh johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between trump &amp; russia.
by the way, if russia was working so hard on the 2016 election, it all took place during the obama admin. why didn't they stop them?
...why did democratic national committee turn down the dhs offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). it's all a big dem hoax!
...why did the dnc refuse to turn over its server to the fbi, and still hasn't? it's all a big dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
i certainly hope the democrats do not force nancy p out. that would be very bad for the republican party - and please let cryin' chuck stay!
with all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, i have no idea...

weekly address 
just out: the obama administration knew far in advance of november 8th about election meddling by russia. did nothing about it. why?
democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums &amp; deductibles increase by over 100%. remember keep your doctor, keep your plan?
since the obama administration was told way before the 2016 election that the russians were meddling, why no action? focus on them, not t!
obama administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on russian meddling of election. they didn't want to hurt hillary?
i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer!
make america great again!
hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders. is she allowed to so collude? unfair to bernie!
i am on foxandfriends - enjoy!
the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists, they have no policies or ideas. all they do is delay and complain.they own obamacare!
the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win..
...and did not want to "rock the boat." he didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good.
the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling. with 4 months looking at russia...
..under a magnifying glass, they have zero "tapes" of t people colluding. there is no collusion &amp; no obstruction. i should be given apology!
republican senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the democrats. not easy! perhaps just let ocare crash &amp; burn!
very grateful for the 9-o decision from the u. s. supreme court. we must keep america safe!
from foxnews "bombshell: in 2016, obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an american election."  check out his statement - witch hunt!
great day for america's future security and safety, courtesy of the u.s. supreme court. i will keep fighting for the american people, &amp; win!
wow, cnn had to retract big story on "russia," with 3 employees forced to resign. what about all the other phony stories they do? fake news!
fake news cnn is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony russian stories. ratings way down!
so they caught fake news cnn cold, but what about nbc, cbs &amp; abc? what about the failing nytimes &amp; washingtonpost? they are all fake news!
with zero democrats to help, and a failed, expensive and dangerous obamacare as the dems legacy, the republican senators are working hard!
i just finished a great meeting with the republican senators concerning healthcare. they really want to get it right, unlike ocare!
the failing nytimes writes false story after false story about me. they don't even call to verify the facts of a story. a fake news joke!
some of the fake news media likes to say that i am not totally engaged in healthcare. wrong, i know the subject well &amp; want victory for u.s.
the amazonwashingtonpost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is fake news!

republicans should just repeal failing obamacare now &amp; work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate. dems will join in!
we were let down by all of the democrats and a few republicans. most republicans were loyal, terrific &amp; worked really hard. we will return!
as i have always said, let obamacare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. stay tuned!
with only a very small majority, the republicans in the house &amp; senate need more victories next year since dems totally obstruct, no votes!
the senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. even parts of full repeal need 60. 8 dems control senate. crazy!
fake news story of secret dinner with putin is "sick." all g 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the chancellor of germany. press knew!
the fake news is becoming more and more dishonest! even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in germany is made to look sinister!
i will be having lunch at the white house today with republican senators concerning healthcare. they must keep their promise to america!
the republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, &amp; it will get even better at lunchtime.the dems scream death as ocare dies!

the very outdated filibuster rule must go. budget reconciliation is killing r's in senate. mitch m, go to 51 votes now and win. it's time!
republicans in the senate will never win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority now. they look like fools and are just wasting time......
....8 dems totally control the u.s. senate. many great republican bills will never pass, like kate's law and complete healthcare. get smart!
if the senate democrats ever got the chance, they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. they are laughing at r's. make change!

north korea has conducted a major nuclear test. their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the united states.....

we will confront any challenge, no matter how strong the winds or high the water. i’m proud to stand with presidents for oneamericaappeal.
hurricane irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen. be safe and get out of its way,if possible. federal g is ready!
our incredible u.s. coast guard saved more than 15,000 lives last week with harvey. irma could be even tougher. we love our coast guard!
republicans, sorry, but i've been hearing about repeal &amp; replace for 7 years, didn't happen! even worse, the senate filibuster rule will....
...never allow the republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. it is a repub death wish!
republicans must start the tax reform/tax cut legislation asap. don't wait until the end of september. needed now more than ever. hurry!

china has a business tax rate of 15%. we should do everything possible to match them in order to win with our economy. jobs and wages!
crooked hillary clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. she lost the debates and lost her direction!
the "deplorables" came back to haunt hillary.they expressed their feelings loud and clear. she spent big money but, in the end, had no game!
no deal was made last night on daca. massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. would be subject to vote.
the wall, which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls, will continue to be built.

another attack in london by a loser terrorist.these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of scotland yard. must be proactive!
loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.the internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off &amp; use better!
the travel ban into the united states should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!
we have made more progress in the last nine months against isis than the obama administration has made in 8 years.must be proactive &amp; nasty!

the russia hoax continues, now it's ads on facebook. what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary?
the greatest influence over our election was the fake news media "screaming" for crooked hillary clinton. next, she was a bad candidate!

john mccain never had any intention of voting for this bill, which his governor loves. he campaigned on repeal &amp; replace. let arizona down!
arizona had a 116% increase in obamacare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. chuck schumer sold john mccain a bill of goods. sad
large block grants to states is a good thing to do. better control &amp;  management. great for arizona. mccain let his best friend l.g. down!
i know rand paul and i think he may find a way to get there for the good of the party!
alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under obamacare, worst in the country. deductibles high, people angry! lisa m comes through.
it was great being with luther strange last night in alabama. what great people, what a crowd! vote luther on tuesday.

if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the nfl,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....

very proud of our incredible first lady (flotus.) she is a truly great representative for our country! 
iran just test-fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching israel.they are also working with north korea.not much of an agreement we have!
democrats are laughingly saying that mccain had a "moment of courage." tell that to the people of arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!
roger goodell of nfl just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.tell them to stand!
just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at u.n. if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man, they won't be around much longer!
if nfl fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag &amp; country, you will see change take place fast. fire or suspend!
...nfl attendance and ratings are way down. boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. league should back u.s.
great solidarity for our national anthem and for our country. standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. bad ratings!
please to inform that the champion pittsburgh penguins of the nhl will be joining me at the white house for ceremony. great team!
courageous patriots have fought and died for our great american flag --- we must honor and respect it!  make america great again!
alaska, arizona, maine and kentucky are big winners in the healthcare proposal. 7 years of repeal &amp; replace and some senators not there.
sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country. nfl should change policy!
making america safe is my number one priority. we will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet. 
so proud of nascar and its supporters and fans. they won't put up with disrespecting our country or our flag - they said it loud and clear!
many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). these are fans who demand respect for our flag!
the issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. it is about respect for our country, flag and national anthem. nfl must respect this!
the white house never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. important meetings taking place today. big tax cuts &amp; reform.

“what happened”  “how team hillary played the press for fools on russia” ➡️  now we know! 
very little reporting about the great gdp numbers announced yesterday (3.0 despite the big hurricane hits). best consecutive q's in years!
just read the nice remarks by president jimmy carter about me and how badly i am treated by the press (fake news). thank you mr. president!
today is national prescription drug take back day. everyone can help fight the opioidepidemic by participating!  
after strict consultation with general kelly, the cia and other agencies, i will be releasing all jfkfiles other than the names and...
...addresses of any mentioned person who is still living. i am doing this for reasons of full disclosure, transparency and...
...in order to put any and all conspiracy theories to rest.
happy firstrespondersday to all of our heroes out there. we are forever grateful to you for your service, sacrifice and courage 24/7/365! 
while not at all presidential i must point out that the sloppy michael moore show on broadway was a total bomb and was forced to close. sad!
jfk files are released, long ahead of schedule!
as usual, the obamacare premiums will be up (the dems own it), but we will repeal &amp; replace and have great healthcare soon after tax cuts!
never seen such republican anger &amp; unity as i have concerning the lack of investigation on clinton made fake dossier (now $12,000,000?),....
...the uranium to russia deal, the  33,000 plus deleted emails, the comey fix and so much more. instead they look at phony trump/russia,....
..."collusion," which doesn't exist. the dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) witch hunt for evil politics, but the r's...
...are now fighting back like never before. there is so much guilt by democrats/clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. do something!
all of this "russia" talk right when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts &amp; reform. is this coincidental? not!
report out that obama campaign paid $972,000 to fusion gps. the firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from dnc. nobody knows who ok'd!
great job by michaelcaputo on foxandfriends.
sorry, but this is years ago, before paul manafort was part of the trump campaign. but why aren't crooked hillary &amp; the dems the focus?????
....also, there is no collusion!
the fake news is working overtime. as paul manaforts lawyer said, there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he...
....came to the campaign. few people knew the young, low level volunteer named george, who has already proven to be a liar. check the dems!
i hope people will start to focus on our massive tax cuts for business (jobs) and the middle class (in addition to democrat corruption)!
the biggest story yesterday, the one that has the dems in a dither, is podesta running from his firm. what he know about crooked dems is....
....earth shattering. he and his brother could drain the swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. fake news weak!
“statement by president trump on the apprehension of mustafa al-imam for his alleged role in benghazi attacks”

in nyc, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. law enforcement is following this closely. not in the u.s.a.!
we must not allow isis to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the middle east and elsewhere. enough!
my thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the new york city terrorist attack. god and your country are with you!
the republican house members are working hard (and late) toward the massive tax cuts that they know you deserve. these will be biggest ever!
i have just ordered homeland security to step up our already extreme vetting program. being politically correct is fine, but not for this!
the terrorist came into our country through what is called the "diversity visa lottery program," a chuck schumer beauty. i want merit based.
we are fighting hard for merit based immigration, no more democrat lottery systems. we must get much tougher (and smarter).  foxandfriends
"senator chuck schumer helping to import europes problems" said col.tony shaffer. we will stop this craziness!  foxandfriends
nycstrong usa 
wouldn't it be great to repeal the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate in obamacare and use those savings for further tax cuts.....
....for the middle class. the house and senate should consider asap as the process of final approval moves along. push biggest tax cuts ever
we mourn the horrifying terrorist attack in nyc. all of america is praying and grieving for the families who lost their precious loved ones. 
just spoke with nygovcuomo and nycmayor de blasio to let them know that the federal government...
nygovcuomo nycmayor ...fully supports any and all of their efforts with respect to the west side attack. nycstrong
thank you to the great nypd, first responders and all govt officials for having handled the terrible west side attack so professionally! 
thanks to senatemajldr mcconnell and the senategop we are appointing high-quality federal district...
senatemajldr senategop ...and appeals court judges at a record clip! our courts are rapidly changing for the better!
chain migration must end now! some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. not acceptable! 
just spoke to president macri of argentina about the five proud and wonderful men killed in the west side terror attack. god be with them!
the united states will be immediately implementing much tougher extreme vetting procedures. the safety of our citizens comes first!
it is finally happening for our great clean coal miners! 
happy birthday to garyplayer, a truly great champion and person!
great mtg w/ cabinet today. tomorrow, i will be announcing the new head of the fed. i think you will be extremely impressed by this person! 
nyc terrorist was happy as he asked to hang isis flag in his hospital room. he killed 8 people, badly injured 12. should get death penalty!
would love to send the nyc terrorist to guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system...
...there is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. should move fast. death penalty!
congratulations to the houston astros, 2017 worldseries champions⚾️houstonstrong earnhistory 
i am calling on congress to terminate the diversity visa lottery program that presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security. 
congress must end chain migration so that we can have a system that is security based! we need to make america safe! usa 
today, we are thrilled to welcome broadcom ceo hock tan to the wh to announce he is moving their hq’s from singapore back to the u.s.a.....

today, it was my pleasure and great honor to announce my nomination of jerome powell to be the next chairman of the federalreserve. 
great tax cut rollout today. the lobbyists are storming capital hill, but the republicans will hold strong and do what is right for america!
donna brazile just stated the dnc rigged the system to illegally steal the primary from bernie sanders. bought and paid for by crooked h....
....this is real collusion and dishonesty. major violation of campaign finance laws and money laundering - where is our justice department?
the tuckercarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great fbi was so sad to watch. james comey's leadership was a disaster!
i will be interviewed by ingrahamangle on foxnews at 10:00. enjoy!
my twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. i guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.
everybody is asking why the justice department (and fbi) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with crooked hillary &amp; the dems..
...new donna b book says she paid for and stole the dem primary. what about the deleted e-mails, uranium, podesta, the server, plus, plus...
....people are angry.  at some point the justice department, and the fbi, must do what is right and proper. the american public deserves it!
the real story on collusion is in donna b's new book. crooked hillary bought the dnc &amp; then stole the democratic primary from crazy bernie!
pocahontas just stated that the democrats, lead by the legendary crooked hillary clinton, rigged the primaries! lets go fbi &amp; justice dept.
isis just claimed the degenerate animal who killed, and so badly wounded, the wonderful people on the west side, was "their soldier." .....
...based on that, the military has hit isis "much harder" over the last two days. they will pay a big price for every attack on us!
bernie sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the dem primary by crooked hillary!
i always felt i would be running and winning against bernie sanders, not crooked h, without cheating, i was right.
just took off for ceremony  pearl harbor. will then be heading to japan, skorea, china, vietnam &amp; the philippines. will never let you down!
the rigged dem primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got zero coverage on fake news network tv last night. disgraceful!

getting ready to leave for south korea and meetings with president moon, a fine gentleman. we will figure it all out!
i have great confidence in king salman and the crown prince of saudi arabia, they know exactly what they are doing....
....some of those they are harshly treating have been “milking” their country for years!
it was my great honor to have lunch with our incredible u.s. and rok troops at camp humphreys, in south korea.   
thank you to president moon of south korea for the beautiful welcoming ceremony. it will always be remembered. 
stock market hit yet another all-time record high yesterday. there is great confidence in the moves that my administration....
....is making. working very hard on tax cuts for the middle class, companies and jobs!
ralph northam will allow crime to be rampant in virginia. he’s weak on crime, weak on our great vets, anti-second amendment....
....and has been horrible on virginia economy. vote edwgillespie today!

getting ready to make a major speech to the national assembly here in south korea, then will be headed to china where i very much look forward to meeting with president xi who is just off his great political victory.
ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for. don’t forget, republicans won 4 out of 4 house seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!
join me live in south korea nationalassembly potusinasia  ➡️ 
the u.s., under my administration, is completely rebuilding its military, and they're spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world, being built right now. i want peace through strength! 
the north korean regime has pursued its nuclear &amp; ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance, agreement, &amp; commmitment it has made to the u.s. and its allies. it's broken all of those commitments... 
anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the u.s. should look to our past....and you will doubt it no longer. 
together, we dream of a korea that is free, a peninsula that is safe, and families that are reunited once again! 
leaving south korea now heading to china. looking very much forward to meeting and being with president xi!
on behalf of flotus melania and i, thank you for an unforgettable afternoon and evening at the forbidden city in beijing, president xi and madame peng liyuan. we are looking forward to rejoining you tomorrow morning! 
noko has interpreted america's past restraint as weakness. this would be a fatal miscalculation. do not underestimate us. and do not try us. 
looking forward to a full day of meetings with president xi and our delegations tomorrow. thank you for the beautiful welcome china! flotus melania and i will never forget it! 
congratulations to all of the ”deplorables” and the millions of people who gave us a massive (304-227) electoral college landslide victory! 
president xi, thank you for such an incredible welcome ceremony. it was a truly memorable and impressive display!  
in the coming months and years ahead i look forward to building an even stronger relationship between the united states and china.  
i don’t blame china, i blame the incompetence of past admins for allowing china to take advantage of the u.s. on trade leading up to a point where the u.s. is losing $100's of billions. how can you blame china for taking advantage of people that had no clue? i would've done same!
my meetings with president xi jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of north korea. he is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people. it was great being with him and madame peng liyuan!
i am leaving china for apec2017 in vietnam. flotus melania is staying behind to see the zoo, and of course, the great wall of china before going to alaska to greet our amazing troops.
just landed in da nang, vietnam to deliver a speech at apec2017
throughout my travels, i've had the pleasure of sharing the good news from america. i've had the honor of sharing our vision for a free &amp; open indo-pacific -- a place where sovereign &amp; independent nations, w/diverse cultures &amp; many different dreams, can all prosper side-by-side. 
in more and more places throughout this region, citizens of sovereign and independent nations have taken greater control of their destinies, and unlocked the potential of their people. apec2017 
today i am here to offer a renewed partnership with america -- to work together to strengthen the bonds of friendship and commerce between all of the nations of the indo-pacific, and together, to promote our prosperity and security. apec2017 
the united states is prepared to work with each of the leaders in this room today to achieve mutually beneficial commerce that is in the interests of both your countries and mine. that is the message i am here to deliver today. apec2017 
the united states has been reminded time and again in recent years that economic security is not merely related to national security -economic security is national security. it is vital to our national strength. apec2017

“presidential proclamation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the vietnam war”  ➡️  ➡️ 
president xi of china has stated that he is upping the sanctions against noko. said he wants them to denuclearize. progress is being made.
will be doing a joint press conference in hanoi, vietnam then heading for final destination of trip, the phillipines.
met with president putin of russia who was at apec meetings. good discussions on syria. hope for his help to solve, along with china the dangerous north korea crisis. progress being made.
when will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. there always playing politics - bad for our country. i want to solve north korea, syria, ukraine, terrorism, and russia can greatly help!
does the fake news media remember when crooked hillary clinton, as secretary of state, was begging russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with putin.
why would kim jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when i would never call him "short and fat?" oh well, i try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!
just landed in the philippines after a great day of meetings and events in hanoi, vietnam!

will be leaving the philippines tomorrow after many days of constant mtgs &amp; work in order to maga! my promises are rapidly being fulfilled.
happy to announce, i am nominating alex azar to be the next hhs secretary. he will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!
i am proud of the rep. house &amp; senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {&amp; reform.} we’re getting close! now, how about ending the unfair &amp; highly unpopular indiv mandate in ocare &amp; reducing taxes even further? cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?
excited to be heading home to see the house pass a great tax bill with the middle class getting big tax cuts!  makeamericagreatagain
great to see randpaul looking well and back on the senate floor. he will help us with tax cuts and reform!
after my tour of asia, all countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed. the united states has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion. the massive trade deficits must go down quickly!
just arrived at asean50 in the philippines for my final stop with world leaders. will lead to fair trade deals, unlike the horror shows from past administrations. will then be leaving for d.c. made many good friends!
i will be making a major statement from the whitehouse upon my return to d.c. time and date to be set.
one of the most accurate polls last time around. but fakenews likes to say we’re in the 30’s. they are wrong. some people think numbers could be in the 50's. together, we will make america great again! 
thank you to the amazing staff and their families of the united states embassy in the philippines. keep up the great work! 
thank you asia! usa 
may god be with the people of sutherland springs, texas. the fbi and law enforcement has arrived.
just returned from asia after 12 very successful days. great to be home!
our great country is respected again in asia. you will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!
.foxandfriends will be showing much of our successful trip to asia, and the friendships &amp; benefits that will endure for years to come!
while in the philippines i was forced to watch cnn, which i have not done in months, and again realized how bad, and fake, it is. loser!
thank you, working hard! 
thank you! 
do you think the three ucla basketball players will say thank you president trump? they were headed for 10 years in jail!
the failing nytimes hates the fact that i have developed a great relationship with world leaders like xi jinping, president of china.....
...they should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing. the u.s. is being respected again. watch trade!
it is actually hard to believe how naive (or dumb) the failing nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy...weak and ineffective!
why are democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business (jobs)? the reason: obstruction and delay!
big vote tomorrow in the house. tax cuts are getting close!
to the three ucla basketball players i say:  you're welcome, go out and give a big thank you to president xi jinping of china who made.....
....your release possible and, have a great life! be careful, there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life!
china is sending an envoy and delegation to north korea - a big move, we'll see what happens!
need all on the un security council to vote to renew the joint investigative mechanism for syria to ensure that assad regime does not commit mass murder with chemical weapons ever again.
congratulations to the house of representatives for passing the taxcutsandjobsact — a big step toward fulfilling our promise to deliver historic tax cuts for the american people by the end of the year! 
big win today in the house for gop tax cuts and reform, 227-205. zero dems, they want to raise taxes much higher, but not for our military!
the al frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words. where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 while she sleeps? .....
.and to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women. lesley stahl tape?
great numbers on stocks and the economy. if we get tax cuts and reform, we'll really see some great results!
if democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes, we would be able to get many of their ideas into bill!
together, we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities, and we're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel, ms13, and many other gangs...  'hundreds arrested in ms-13 crackdown'  
today, it was an honor to celebrate the collegiate national champions of 2016/2017 at the whitehouse!  ncaachampionsphotos:  
put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as i review all conservation facts. under study for years. will update soon with secretary zinke. thank you!
crooked hillary clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time. she just can’t stop, which is so good for the republican party. hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years!
now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail, lavar ball, the father of liangelo, is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. i should have left them in jail!
sen. jeff flake(y), who is unelectable in the great state of arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite president. he’ll be a no on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast.”
shoplifting is a very big deal in china, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father lavar. should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead. china told them why they were released. very ungrateful!
big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of elephants or any other animal.
border patrol officer killed at southern border, another badly hurt. we will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. we will, and must, build the wall!
republican senators are working very hard to get tax cuts and tax reform approved. hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the american public!
marshawn lynch of the nfl’s oakland raiders stands for the mexican anthem and sits down to boos for our national anthem. great disrespect! next time nfl should suspend him for remainder of season. attendance and ratings way down.
under president trump unemployment rate will drop below 4%.  analysts predict economic boom for 2018!  foxandfriends and varneyco
president donald j. trump and flotus melania participate in the pardoning of the national thanksgiving turkey at the white house. 
today, we continued a wonderful american tradition at the white house. drumstick and wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful blue ridge mountains at gobbler’s rest... 
it wasn’t the white house, it wasn’t the state department, it wasn’t father lavar’s so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - it was me. too bad! lavar is just a poor man’s version of don king, but without the hair. just think..
...lavar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china, but no nba contract to support you. but remember lavar, shoplifting is not a little thing. it’s a really big deal, especially in china. ungrateful fool!
the nfl is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the locker room during the national anthem next season. that’s almost as bad as kneeling! when will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart? this issue is killing your league!.....
another crooked hillary fan! 
will be having meetings and working the phones from the winter white house in florida (mar-a-lago). stock market hit new record high yesterday - $5.5 trillion gain since e. many companies coming back to the u.s. military building up and getting very strong.
the usnavy is conducting search and rescue following aircraft crash. we are monitoring the situation. prayers for all involved. 
51 million american to travel this weekend - highest number in twelve years (aaa). traffic and airports are running very smoothly!  foxnews
i have long given the order to help argentina with the search and rescue mission of their missing submarine. 45 people aboard and not much time left. may god be with them and the people of argentina!
....and it will get even better with tax cuts! 
happy thanksgiving, your country is starting to do really well. jobs coming back, highest stock market ever, military getting really strong, we will build the wall, v.a. taking care of our vets, great supreme court justice, record cut in regs, lowest unemployment in 17 years....!
theplumlinegs make america great again!
make america great again!
will be doing a live thanksgiving video teleconference with members of the military at 9:00 a.m.  afghanistan, iraq, uss monterey, turkey &amp; bahrain. then going to coast guard quarters, florida.
happy thanksgiving! 
my great honor to join our incredible men and women of the uscg, at the lake worth inlet station, in riviera beach, florida today! happythanksgiving 
obamacare premiums are going up, up, up, just as i have been predicting for two years. obamacare is owned by the democrats, and it is a disaster. but do not worry. even though the dems want to obstruct, we will repeal &amp; replace right after tax cuts!
a great guy (with great ratings)! 
two great people! 
can you believe that the disrespect for our country, our flag, our anthem continues without penalty to the players. the commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. players are the boss! 
will be speaking to president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that i inherited in the middle east. i will get it all done, but what a mistake, in lives and dollars (6 trillion), to be there in the first place!
after turkey call i will be heading over to trump national golf club, jupiter, to play golf (quickly) with tiger woods and dustin johnson. then back to mar-a-lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the usa!
horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in egypt. the world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!
will be calling the president of egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life. we have to get tougher and smarter than ever before, and we will. need the wall, need the ban! god bless the people of egypt.
time magazine called to say that i was probably going to be named “man (person) of the year,” like last year, but i would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. i said probably is no good and took a pass. thanks anyway!
happy smallbusinesssaturday!  a great day to support your community and america’s job creators by shopping locally at a smallbiz. shopsmall 
the consumer financial protection bureau, or cfpb, has been a total disaster as run by the previous administrations pick. financial institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. we will bring it back to life!
check out the recent editorial in the wall street journal wsj about what a complete disaster the cfpb has been under its leader from previous administration, who just quit!
.foxnews is much more important in the united states than cnn, but outside of the u.s., cnn international is still a major source of (fake) news, and they represent our nation to the world very poorly. the outside world does not see the truth from them!
wow, even i didn’t realize we did so much. wish the fake news would report! thank you. 
the last thing we need in alabama and the u.s. senate is a schumer/pelosi puppet who is weak on crime, weak on the border, bad for our military and our great vets, bad for our 2nd amendment, and wants to raises taxes to the sky. jones would be a disaster!
i endorsed luther strange in the alabama primary. he shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough. can’t let schumer/pelosi win this race. liberal jones would be bad!
since the first day i took office, all you hear is the phony democrat excuse for losing the election, russia, russia,russia.  despite this i have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month president. make america great again!
back in d.c., big week for tax cuts and many other things of great importance to our country.  senate republicans will hopefully come through for all of us. the tax cut bill is getting better and better. the end result will be great for all!
we should have a contest as to which of the networks, plus cnn and not including fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite president (me). they are all bad. winner to receive the fake news trophy!
the good news is that their ratings are terrible, nobody cares! 
the tax cut bill is coming along very well, great support. with just a few changes, some mathematical, the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well!
new home sales reach a 10 year high. stock market has more record gains. hopefully republican senators will give us the much needed tax cuts to keep it all going! democrats want big tax increases.
thank you rand! 
at least 24 players kneeling this weekend at nfl stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. the american public is fed up with the disrespect the nfl is paying to our country, our flag and our national anthem. weak and out of control!
melania, our great and very hard working first lady, who truly loves what she is doing, always thought that “if you run, you will win.” she would tell everyone that, “no doubt, he will win.” i also felt i would win (or i would not have run) - and country is doing great!
meeting with “chuck and nancy” today about keeping government open and working. problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our country unchecked, are weak on crime and want to substantially raise taxes. i don’t see a deal!
“statement from president donald j. trump on givingtuesday” 
remarks from the roosevelt room with senatemajldr mitch mcconnell, speakerryan and secretary of defense, general james mattis. 
dow, s&amp;p 500 and nasdaq all finished the day at new record highs! 
“the conference board said that consumer sentiment was at its highest level in nearly 17 years in november. the consumer confidence index rose from 126.2 in october to 129.5, notching its best reading since december 2000...” 
after north korea missile launch, it's more important than ever to fund our gov't &amp; military! dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty &amp; illegal immigration. i ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. they can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
charles mccullough, the respected fmr intel comm inspector general, said public was misled on crooked hillary emails. “emails endangered national security.” why aren’t our deep state authorities looking at this? rigged &amp; corrupt? tuckercarlson seanhannity
just won the lawsuit on leadership of consumer financial protection bureau, cfpb. a big win for the consumer!
great work ivanka! 
great day for tax cuts and the republican party. but the biggest winner will be our great country!
.foxandfriends, we are in record territory in all things having to do with our economy! 
great, and we should boycott fake news cnn. dealing with them is a total waste of time! 
looks like another great day for the stock market. consumer confidence is at record high. i guess somebody likes me (my policies)!
wow, matt lauer was just fired from nbc for “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.” but when will the top executives at nbc &amp; comcast be fired for putting out so much fake news. check out andy lack’s past!
so now tha matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in florida years ago? investigate!
so now that matt lauer is gone when will the fake news practitioners at nbc be terminating the contract of phil griffin? and will they terminate low ratings joe scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in florida years ago? investigate!
just spoke to president xi jinping of china concerning the provocative actions of north korea. additional major sanctions will be imposed on north korea today. this situation will be handled!
economy growing! excluding hurricane effects, cea estimates that real gdp growth would have been 3.9% in q3.  stock market at a new high, unemployment at a low. we are winning and tax cuts will shift our economy into high gear! 
departing jba_nafw for st. charles, missouri to help push our plan for historic tax cuts across the finish line.  a successful vote in the senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the american people!  
this week, the senate can join the house &amp; take a strong stand for the middle class families who are the backbone of america. together, we will give the american people a big, beautiful christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets americans keep more of their hard-earned money! 
a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put america first. it is time to take care of our workers, to protect our communities, and to rebuild our great country!  
now, we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to restore american prosperity – and reclaim america’s destiny.  but in order to achieve this bright and glowing future, the senate must pass tax cuts – and bring main street roaring back to life!  
theresa theresamay, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom. we are doing just fine!
.theresa_may, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom. we are doing just fine!
the house of representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the justicedepartment and the fbi for withholding key documents and an fbi witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of donald trump. big stuff. deep state. give this information now! foxnews
the only people who don’t like the tax cut bill are the people that don’t understand it or the obstructionist democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the republicans!
“had the information (crooked hillary’s emails) been released there would have been harm to national security...." charles mccullough fmr intel comm inspector general 
funny to hear the democrats talking about the national debt when president obama doubled it in only 8 years!
the failing nytimes, the pipe organ for the democrat party, has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive tax cut bill. they are wrong so often that now i know we have a winner!
the failing nytimes has totally gone against the social media guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went rogue!  foxandfriends
the chinese envoy, who just returned from north korea, seems to have had no impact on little rocket man. hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions. russia and china condemned the launch.
stock market hits new record high. confidence and enthusiasm abound. more great numbers coming out!
the dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another all-time record). if the dems had won the presidential election, the market would be down 50% from these levels and consumer confidence, which is also at an all-time high, would be “low and glum!”
thank you senorrinhatch. let’s continue making america great again!  
today, it was my great honor to meet with the crown prince of bahrain at the whitehouse. bahrain and the united states are important partners.  during the crown prince’s visit, he is advancing $9 billion in commercial deals, including finalizing the purchase of f-16’s... 
our fifth 1k milestone of 2017! dow24k maga 
today is a day that i’ve been looking very much forward to all year long. it is one that you have heard me speak about many times before.   now, as president of the united states, it is my tremendous honor to finally wish america and the world, a very merry christmas! 
the christmas story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother, a father, their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of god’s love for all of humanity.  whatever our beliefs, we know that the birth of jesus christ and the story of his life... 
a disgraceful verdict in the kate steinle case! no wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration.
the kate steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. his exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. build the wall!
the jury was not told the killer of kate was a 7 time felon. the schumer/pelosi democrats are so weak on crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections.
republicans senators are working hard to pass the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. the bill is getting better and better. this is a once in a generation chance. obstructionist dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
the media has been speculating that i fired rex tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - fake news! he’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (i call the final shots) we work well together and america is highly respected again! 
economists on the tax cuts and jobs act:  “the enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations...” 
we are one step closer to delivering massive tax cuts for working families across america. special thanks to senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and chairman senorrinhatch for shepherding our bill through the senate. look forward to signing a final bill before christmas! 
biggest tax bill and tax cuts in history just passed in the senate. now these great republicans will be going for final passage. thank you to house and senate republicans for your hard work and commitment!
i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi. he has pled guilty to those lies. it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. there was nothing to hide!
62 years ago this week, a brave seamstress in montgomery, alabama uttered one word that changed history... 
great job first lady melania! 
so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed, while crooked hillary clinton, on that now famous fbi holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? rigged system, or just a double standard?
many people in our country are asking what the “justice” department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary, after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 emails? no justice!
congratulations to abc news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia, russia, russia witch hunt. more networks and “papers” should do the same with their fake news!
i never asked comey to stop investigating flynn. just more fake news covering another comey lie!
such a total miscarriage of justice in san francisco! 
tainted (no, very dishonest?) fbi “agent’s role in clinton probe under review.” led clinton email probe. foxandfriends  clinton money going to wife of another fbi agent in charge.
after years of comey, with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation (and more), running the fbi, its reputation is in tatters - worst in history! but fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.
people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of abc news (he has been suspended), should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
report: “anti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probe”  now it all starts to make sense!
democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama. we need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, border wall, military, pro life, v.a., judges 2nd amendment and more. no to jones, a pelosi/schumer puppet!
putting pelosi/schumer liberal puppet jones into office in alabama would hurt our great republican agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more. look at your 401-k’s since election. highest stock market ever! jobs are roaring back!
with the great vote on cutting taxes, this could be a big day for the stock market - and you!
a must watch: legal scholar alan dershowitz was just on foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest witch hunt in u.s. political history. enjoy!
yesterday, i was thrilled to be with so many wonderful friends, in utah’s magnificent capitol.  it was my honor to sign two presidential proclamations that will modify the national monuments designations of both bears ears and grand staircase escalante...  
join me this friday in pensacola, florida at the pensacola bay center! tickets:  
make america great again!
our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of california’s wildfires. i encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials. thank you to all first responders for your incredible work! 
join me live from the whitehouse via periscope 
i have determined that it is time to officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel. i am also directing the state department to begin preparation to move the american embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem...

national pearl harbor remembrance day - “a day that will live in infamy!” december 7, 1941
today, our entire nation pauses to remember pearl harbor—and the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for america.   god bless our heroes who wear the uniform, and god bless the united states of america. pearlharborremembranceday 
today, the u.s. flag flies at half-staff at the whitehouse, in honor of national pearl harbor remembrance day.  
today, as we remember pearl harbor, it was an incredible honor to be joined with surviving veterans of the attack on 12/7/1941. they are heroes, and they are living witnesses to american history. all american hearts are filled with gratitude for their service and their sacrifice. 
across the battlefields, oceans, and harrowing skies of europe and the pacific throughout the war, one great battle cry could be heard by america’s friends and foes alike: “remember pearl harbor.” 
tonight, flotus melania and i were thrilled to welcome so many wonderful friends to the whitehouse – and wish them all a very happyhanukkah  
i fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t! 
big crowd expected today in pensacola, florida, for a make america great again speech. we have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! see you there!
last thing the make america great again agenda needs is a liberal democrat in senate where we have so little margin for victory already. the pelosi/schumer puppet jones would vote against us 100% of the time. he’s bad on crime, life, border, vets, guns &amp; military. vote roy moore!
fines and penalties against wells fargo bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. i will cut regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
make america great again! 
“the unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4.1%. the unemployment rate in manufacturing dropped to 2.6%, the lowest ever recorded. the unemployment rate among hispanics dropped to 4.7%, the lowest ever recorded...” secretaryacosta usdol 
on my way to pensacola, florida. see everyone soon! maga 
just arrived at the pensacola bay center. join me live on foxnews in 10 minutes! maga 
this is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most. so speak up, be heard, and fight, fight, fight for the change you've been waiting for your entire life!  merry christmas and thank you pensacola, florida! 
we believe that every american should stand for the national anthem, and we proudly pledge allegiance to one nation under god! 
great evening last night in pensacola, florida. arena was packed to the rafters, the crowd was loud, loving and really smart. they definitely get what’s going on. thank you pensacola!
a big contingent of very enthusiastic roy moore fans at the rally last night. we can’t have a pelosi/schumer liberal democrat, jones, in that important alabama senate seat. need your vote to make america great again! jones will always vote against what we must do for our country.
fake news cnn made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. they were caught red handed, just like lonely brian ross at abc news (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”). watch to see if cnn fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?
cnn’s slogan is cnn, the most trusted name in news. everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the american public. there are many outlets that are far more trusted than fake news cnn. their slogan should be cnn, the least trusted name in news!
heading to the great state of mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected governor, philbryantms. look forward to seeing the new civil rights museum!
it was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the mississippi state history museum &amp; the mississippi civil rights museum. we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past &amp; dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice &amp; peace. 
have a great game today, usarmy and usnavy - i will be watching.   we love our u.s. military. on behalf of an entire nation, thank you for your sacrifice and service!  armynavygame usa 
.daveweigel washingtonpost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before i arrived  the venue, w/ thousands of people outside, on their way in. real photos now shown as i spoke. packed house, many people unable to get in. demand apology &amp; retraction from fake news wapo! 
.daveweigel of the washington post just admitted that his picture was a fake (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in pensacola when, in fact, he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on t.v.). fake news, he should be fired.
great army - navy game. army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s trophy (last time was 1996). wow! congratulations!
great army - navy game. army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the commander-in-chief’s trophy! congratulations!
no american should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. our cities should be sanctuaries for americans – not for criminal aliens! 
things are going really well for our economy, a subject the fake news spends as little time as possible discussing! stock market hit another record high, unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the usa. really good news, and much more to come!
getting closer and closer on the tax cut bill. shaping up even better than projected. house and senate working very hard and smart. end result will be not only important, but special!
very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the fake news media. they are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on america!
another false story, this time in the failing nytimes, that i watch 4-8 hours of television a day - wrong!  also, i seldom, if ever, watch cnn or msnbc, both of which i consider fake news. i never watch don lemon, who i once called the “dumbest man on television!” bad reporting.
despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the democrats have been unable to show any collusion with russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who i don’t know and/or have never met. fake news!
lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill &amp; crooked-used!
the people of alabama will do the right thing. doug jones is pro-abortion, weak on crime, military and illegal immigration, bad for gun owners and veterans and against the wall. jones is a pelosi/schumer puppet. roy moore will always vote with us. vote roy moore!
consumer confidence is at an all-time high, along with a record high stock market. unemployment is at a 17 year low. make america great again! working to pass massive tax cuts (looking good).
wishing all of those celebrating hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love.  
congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory. the write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. the people of alabama are great, and the republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. it never ends!
the reason i originally endorsed luther strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election.  i was right! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
wow, more than 90% of fake news media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. hence my use of social media, the only way to get the truth out. much of mainstream meadia has become a joke! foxandfriends
if last night’s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate.
thank you omarosa for your service! i wish you continued success.
republican tax cuts are looking very good. all are working hard. in the meantime, the stock market hit another record high!
as a candidate, i promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday, working americans. if you make your voices heard, this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning – the dawn of a brilliant american future shining with patriotism, prosperity and pride! 
today, we gathered in the roosevelt room for one single reason: to cut the red tape! for many decades, an ever-growing maze of regs, rules, and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless american factories, &amp; devastated entire industries. 
when americans are free to thrive, innovate, &amp; prosper, there is no challenge too great, no task too large, &amp; no goal beyond our reach.   we are a nation of explorers, pioneers, innovators &amp; inventors. we are nation of people who work hard, dream big, &amp; who never, ever give up... 
in 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the code of federal regulations. today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the roosevelt room.  today, we cut the red tape! it is time to set free our dreams and make america great again! 
“manufacturing optimism rose to another all-time high in the latest shopfloornam outlook survey”

today, it was my tremendous honor to visit marine helicopter squadron one (hmx-1) at the marine corps air facility in quantico, virginia.   i am honored to serve as your commander-in-chief. on behalf of an entire nation, thank you for your sacrifice and service. we love you!

great job kevin, we are all proud of you! 
congratulations to two great and hardworking guys, corey lewandowski and david bossie, on the success of their just out book, “let trump be trump.” finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!
tax cuts will increase investment in the american economy and in u.s. workers, leading to higher growth, higher wages, and more jobs! 
weekly address 
as a candidate, i promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday working american families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country. now, we are just days away... 
wonderful weekend at camp david. a very special place. a lot of very important work done. heading back to the whitehouse now. 
more than a century after conquering flight, the wrightbrothers continue to motivate &amp; inspire americans, who never tire of exploration &amp; innovation. this great american spirit can be found in the design of every new supersonic jet and next generation:  
remember, republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year. the media refuses to mention this. i said gillespie and moore would lose (for very different reasons), and they did. i also predicted  “i” would win. republicans will do well in 2018, very well! foxandfriends
ivanka trump will be interviewed on foxandfriends.
the train accident that just occurred in dupont, wa shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. seven trillion dollars spent in the middle east while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! not for long!
my thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in dupont, washington. thank you to all of our wonderful first responders who are on the scene. we are currently monitoring here at the white house.
our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in washington state. we are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities... 
over the past 11 months, i have travelled tens of thousands of miles, to visit 13 countries. i have met with more than 100 world leaders and everywhere i traveled, it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the american people! 
when the american people speak, all of us should listen. just over one year ago, you spoke loud and clear. on november 8, 2016, you voted to make america great again! 
as the world watches, we are days away from passing historic tax cuts for american families and businesses. it will be the biggest tax cut and tax reform in the history of our country! 
so true ivanka! 
thank you maria b! 
70 record closes for the dow so far this year! we have never had 70 dow records in a one year period. wow!
with the strategy that i announced today, we are declaring that america is in the game and america is determined to win!  our four pillars of national security strategy: 
together, our task is to strengthen our families, to build up our communities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate american greatness as a shining example to the world.... 
dow rises 5000 points on the year for the first time ever - make america great again!
stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the tax cut bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size. immediate expensing will have a big impact. biggest tax cuts and reform ever passed. enjoy, and create many beautiful jobs!
a  story in the washingtonpost that i was close to “rescinding” the nomination of justice gorsuch prior to confirmation is fake news. i never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a justice of the u.s. supreme court. the unnamed sources don’t exist!
congratulations to paul ryan, kevin mccarthy, kevin brady, steve scalise, cathy mcmorris rodgers and all great house republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!
the united states senate just passed the biggest in history tax cut and reform bill. terrible individual mandate (obamacare)repealed. goes to the house tomorrow morning for final vote. if approved, there will be a news conference at the white house at approximately 1:00 p.m.
the tax cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the fake news is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated dems, and only demean. this is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon. jobs, jobs, jobs!
i would like to congratulate senatemajldr on having done a fantastic job both strategically &amp; politically on the passing in the senate of the massive tax cut &amp; reform bill. i could have not asked for a better or more talented partner. our team will go onto many more victories!
together, we are making america great again! 
we are delivering historic tax relief for the american people! taxcutsandjobsact 
we are making america great again! 
the massive tax cuts, which the fake news media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. companies are already making big payments to workers. dems want to raise taxes, hate these big cuts!
was foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news? you deserve it - three great people! the many fake news hate shows should study your formula for success!
home sales hit best numbers in 10 years! make america great again
house democrats want a shutdown for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular, just passed, tax cuts. house republicans, don’t let this happen. pass the c.r. today and keep our government open!
thank you to everyone who joined me at the whitehouse yesterday. together, we are making america great again!  
our big and very popular tax cut and reform bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. this is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage. merry christmas!
so true! 
at some point, and for the good of the country, i predict we will start working with the democrats in a bipartisan fashion. infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. after having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the middle east, it is time to start rebuilding our country!
“the president has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.” thank you charlie kirk of turning points usa. sadly, the fake mainstream media will never talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. we are compiling a long &amp; beautiful list.
with all my administration has done on legislative approvals (broke harry truman’s record), regulation cutting, judicial appointments, building military, va, tax cuts &amp; reform, record economy/stock market and so much more, i am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
will be signing the biggest ever tax cut and reform bill in 30 minutes in oval office. will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
95% of americans will pay less or, at worst, the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). the dems only want to raise your taxes!
congressman ron desantis is a brilliant young leader, yale and then harvard law, who would make a great governor of florida. he loves our country and is a true fighter!
the united nations security council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional sanctions on north korea. the world wants peace, not death!
today, it was my great honor to sign the largest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. full remarks:  
remember, the most hated part of obamacare is the individual mandate, which is being terminated under our just signed tax cut bill.
how can fbi deputy director andrew mccabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ james comey, of the phony hillary clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by clinton puppets during investigation?
fbi deputy director andrew mccabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!
wow, “fbi lawyer james baker reassigned,” according to foxnews.
the stock market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. so many things accomplished by the trump administration, perhaps more than any other president in first year. sadly, will never be reported correctly by the fake news media!
remember, the republicans are 5-0 in congressional races this year. in senate, i said roy m would lose in alabama and supported big luther strange - and roy lost. virginia candidate was not a “trumper,” and he lost.  good republican candidates will win big!
.foxnews-fbi’s andrew mccabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from m (clinton puppet), he was using, allegedly, his fbi official email account to promote her campaign. you obviously cannot do this. these were the people who were investigating hillary clinton.”
the fake news refuses to talk about how big and how strong our base is. they show fake polls just like they report fake news. despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. make america great again!
the tax cut/reform bill, including massive alaska drilling and the repeal of the highly unpopular individual mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. don’t let the fake news convince you otherwise...and our insider polls are strong!
people are proud to be saying merry christmas again. i am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. merry christmas!!!!!
merry christmas!! 
merry christmas!!! 
i hope everyone is having a great christmas, then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to make america great again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate has been terminated as part of our tax cut bill, which essentially repeals (over time) obamacare, the democrats &amp; republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new healthcare plan!
wow, foxandfrlends  “dossier is bogus. clinton campaign, dnc funded dossier. fbi cannot (after all of this time) verify claims in dossier of russia/trump collusion. fbi tainted.” and they used this crooked hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the trump campaign!
all signs are that business is looking really good for next year, only to be helped further by our tax cut bill. will be a great year for companies and jobs! stock market is poised for another year of success!
“on 1/20 - the day trump was inaugurated - an estimated 35,000 isis fighters held approx 17,500 square miles of territory in both iraq and syria. as of 12/21, the u.s. military estimates the remaining 1,000 or so fighters occupy roughly 1,900 square miles...” via jamiejmcintyre

retail sales are at record numbers. we’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!
caught red handed - very disappointed that china is allowing oil to go into north korea. there will never be a friendly solution to the north korea problem if this continues to happen!
i've been saying it for a long, long time. noko 
together, we are making america great again!  
in the east, it could be the coldest new year’s eve on record. perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old global warming that our country, but not other countries, was going to pay trillions of dollars to protect against. bundle up!
while the fake news loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, foxandfriends just showed that my rating on dec. 28, 2017, was approximately the same as president obama on dec. 28, 2009, which was 47%...and this despite massive negative trump coverage &amp; russia hoax!
why is the united states post office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer? should be charging much more!
the democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration &amp; ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc. we must protect our country at all cost!
many reports of peaceful protests by iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption &amp; its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves. the world is watching! iranprotests
the entire world understands that the good people of iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the united states, that iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most.... 
oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the iranian people will face a choice. the world is watching! 
on taxes: “this is the biggest corporate rate cut ever, going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.this is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. every year the obama wh overstated how the economy would grow. now real economics and jobs.” wsj report
i use social media not because i like to, but because it is the only way to fight a very dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as fake news media. phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. many stories &amp; reports a pure fiction!
jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the u.s. unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically cut, and it will only get better. much more to come!
“trump rally: stocks put 2017 in the record books” 
big protests in iran. the people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. looks like they will not take it any longer. the usa is watching very closely for human rights violations!
if the dems (crooked hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on election day. now they have a great future - and just beginning! 
why would smart voters want to put democrats in congress in 2018 election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the election. people are much better off now not to mention isis, va, judges, strong border, 2nd a, tax cuts &amp; more?
my deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in douglas county dcsheriff, and their families. we love our police and law enforcement - god bless them all! lesm
what a year it’s been, and we're just getting started. together, we are making america great again! happy new year!! 
iran, the number one state of sponsored terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. not good!
as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, i want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest fake news media, a happy and healthy new year. 2018 will be a great year for america!
happy new year! we are making america great again, and much faster than anyone thought possible!
today, it was my great honor to sign a new executive order to ensure veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life. we must ensure that our heroes are given the care and support they so richly deserve!  
as i made very clear today, our country needs the security of the wall on the southern border, which must be part of any daca approval.
thank you gopleader kevin mccarthy! couldn’t agree w/you more. together, we are maga 
.icegov hsi agents and ero officers, on behalf of an entire nation, thank you for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow american’s safe. everyone is so grateful! lawenforcementappreciationday president realdonaldtrump 
it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case (such as daca) always runs to the 9th circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trump/russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. must have tough primary!
the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues. there was no collusion, everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion, &amp; yet on and on it goes. russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. republicans should finally take control!
i want to thank my cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. together, we are delivering results and making america great again!  
today, it was my great honor to welcome prime minister erna solberg of norway to the whitehouse - a great friend and ally of the united states! joint press conference:  
the united states needs the security of the wall on the southern border, which must be part of any daca approval. the safety and security of our country is 1! 
cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes america the place to invest! great news as toyota and mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 jobs and investing $1.6 billion in alabama, helping to further grow our economy! 
good news: toyota and mazda announce giant new huntsville, alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and suv’s a year and employ 4000 people. companies are coming back to the u.s. in a very big way. congratulations alabama!
disproven and paid for by democrats “dossier used to spy on trump campaign. did fbi use intel tool to influence the election?” foxandfriends  did dems or clinton also pay russians? where are hidden and smashed dnc servers? where are crooked hillary emails?  what a mess!
in new quinnipiac poll, 66% of people feel the economy is “excellent or good.” that is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
“house votes on controversial fisa act today.” this is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the trump campaign by the previous administration and others?
“45 year low in illegal immigration this year.” foxandfriends
with that being said, i have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. we need it! get smart!
great news, as a result of our tax cuts &amp; jobs act! 
yesterday, i signed the interdictact (h.r. 2142) with bipartisan members of congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country. together, we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the united states! 
thank you adam levine, the federalist, in interview on foxandfriends  “donald trump is the greatest president our country has ever seen.”
small business poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. all business is just at the beginning of something really special!
more great news as a result of historical tax cuts and reform: fiat chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 billion in michigan plant, relocating their heavy-truck production from mexico to michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to u.s. employees! 
chrysler is moving a massive plant from mexico to michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend. thank you chrysler, a very wise decision. the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trump/pence. plenty of more to follow!
democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border, risking thousands of lives in the process. it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans. we must build a great wall, think merit and end lottery &amp; chain. usa!
reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. bad deal. wanted me to cut ribbon-no!
the so-called bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards. wall was not properly funded, chain &amp; lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime.....
....countries which are doing badly. i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. i want safety and security for our people. i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. i want to fund our military, not do a dem defund....
....because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety, daca has now taken a big step backwards. the dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. get smart, make america great again!
the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for daca!
sadly, democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for daca. take care of our military, and our country, first!
never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. never said “take them out.” made up by dems. i have a wonderful relationship with haitians. probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!
today, it was my great honor to proclaim january 15, 2018, as martin luther king jr., federal holiday. i encourage all americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of dr. king's life and legacy. 
yesterday was a big day for the stock market. jobs are coming back to america. chrysler is coming back to the usa, from mexico and many others will follow. tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. american business is hot again!
the democrats are all talk and no action. they are doing nothing to fix daca. great opportunity missed. too bad!
america first!
yesterday was another big day for jobs and the stock market. chrysler coming back to u.s. (michigan) from mexico and many more companies paying out tax cut money to employees. if dems won in november, market would have tanked! it was headed for disaster.
i don’t believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca. they are all talk and no action. this is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. too bad!
so much fake news is being reported. they don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election!
the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them “i have a good relationship with kim jong un” (of n. korea). obviously i didn’t say that. i said “i’d have a good relationship with kim jong un,” a big difference. fortunately we now record conversations with reporters...
...and they knew exactly what i said and meant. they just wanted a story. fake news!
daca is probably dead because the democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military.
i, as president, want people coming into our country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on merit. no more lotteries! america first
“president trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. tax cut bonuses to more than 2,000,000 workers. most explosive stock market rally that we’ve seen in modern times. 18,000 to 26,000 from election, and grounded in profitability and growth. all trump, not 0...
...big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things). “president trump reversed the policies of president obama, and reversed our economic decline.” thank you stuart varney.  foxandfriends
statement by me last night in florida: “honestly, i don’t think the democrats want to make a deal. they talk about daca, but they don’t want to help..we are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to. they don’t want security at the border, they don’t want.....
...to stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do.” my standard is very simple, america first &amp; make america great again!
senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting. deals can’t get made when there is no trust! durbin blew daca and is hurting our military.
we must have security at our very dangerous southern border, and we must have a great wall to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security. the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military, at a time we need it more than ever. we need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! no more dangerous lottery.
do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. the russian collusion hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the dems. public gets it!
“90% of trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived!foxandfriends
unemployment for black americans is the lowest ever recorded. trump approval ratings with black americans has doubled. thank you, and it will get even (much) better! foxnews
“president donald j. trump proclaims january 16, 2018, as religious freedom day” 
today, it was my honor to welcome president nursultan nazarbayev of kazakhstan to the whitehouse! 
new report from doj &amp; dhs shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born. we have submitted to congress a list of resources and reforms....
....we need to keep america safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based. 
eric trump on foxandfriends  now!
today, we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of congress’ highest civilian honor to our friend, and true american hero, bob dole. congressionalgoldmedal 
i promised that my policies would allow companies like apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the united states. great to see apple follow through as a result of tax cuts. huge win for american workers and the usa! 
during the campaign, i promised to make america great again by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country. i am very proud to see companies like chrysler moving operations from mexico to michigan where there are so many great american workers! 
main street is back! strongest holiday sales bump since the great recession -- beating forecasts by billions of dollars. 
and the fake news winners are... 
despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters i respect and lots of good news for the american people to be proud of!
isis is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more! together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media. we are making america great again!
the wall is the wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it. parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.....
....the wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the u.s. the $20 billion dollar wall is “peanuts” compared to what mexico makes from the u.s. nafta is a bad joke!
will be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone, running for congress in a special election (march 13). rick is a great guy. we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda!
we need the wall for the safety and security of our country. we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. if there is no wall, there is no deal!
chip should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 day, or short term, extension!
a government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the dems care very little about!
departing pittsburgh now, where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers, and to show the world that america is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before! 
america will once again be a nation that thinks big, dreams bigger, and always reaches for the stars. you are the ones who will shape america’s destiny. you are the ones who will restore our prosperity. and you are the ones who are making america great again! maga 
house of representatives needs to pass government funding bill tonight. so important for our country - our military needs it!
government funding bill past last night in the house of representatives. now democrats are needed if it is to pass in the senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. shutdown coming? we need more republican victories in 2018!
.whitehouse briefing with director marc short and director mick mulvaney... 
“shutting down the government is a very serious thing. people die, accidents happen. i don’t know how i would vote right now on a cr, ok?” sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif) 
today, i was honored and proud to address the 45th annual march_for_life! you are living witnesses of this year’s march for life theme: lovesaveslives. 
just signed 702 bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. this is not the same fisa law that was so wrongly abused during the election. i will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the american people first!
excellent preliminary meeting in oval with senschumer - working on solutions for security and our great military together with senatemajldr mcconnell and speakerryan. making progress - four week extension would be best!
not looking good for our great military or safety &amp; security on the very dangerous southern border. dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.
democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border. they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead. weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through mess!
this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present. democratshutdown
for those asking, the republicans only have 51 votes in the senate, and they need 60. that is why we need to win more republicans in 2018 election! we can then be even tougher on  crime (and border), and even better to our military &amp; veterans!
america first!
democrats are holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. can’t let that happen!
beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all women to march. get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. lowest female unemployment in 18 years!
unprecedented success for our country, in so many ways, since the election. record stock market, strong on military, crime, borders, &amp; isis, judicial strength &amp; numbers, lowest unemployment for women &amp; all, massive tax cuts, end of individual mandate - and so much more. big 2018!
the trump administration has terminated more unnecessary regulation, in just twelve months, than any other administration has terminated during their full term in office, no matter what the length. the good news is, there is much more to come!
eric trump on judgejeanine on foxnews now!
great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border. the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. if stalemate continues, republicans should go to 51% (nuclear option) and vote on real, long term budget, no c.r.’s!
thank you to brad blakeman on foxnews for grading year one of my presidency with an “a”-and likewise to doug schoen for the very good grade and statements. working hard!
the democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. not good!
democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. they don’t want to do it but are powerless!
end the democrats obstruction! 
big win for republicans as democrats cave on shutdown. now i want a big win for everyone, including republicans, democrats and daca, but especially for our great military and border security. should be able to get there. see you at the negotiating table!
even crazy jim acosta of fake news cnn agrees: “trump world and wh sources dancing in end zone: trump wins again...schumer and dems caved...gambled and lost.” thank you for your honesty jim!
in one of the biggest stories in a long time, the fbi says it is now missing five months worth of lovers strzok - page texts, perhaps 50,000, all in prime time. wow!
in one of the biggest stories in a long time, the fbi now says it is missing five months worth of lovers strzok-page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. wow!
nobody knows for sure that the republicans &amp; democrats will be able to reach a deal on daca by february 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on military strength and border security. the dems have just learned that a shutdown is not the answer!
thank you to general john kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the staff and others in the white house, for a job well done. long hours and fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to win, and few have won more than us!
where are the 50,000 important text messages between fbi lovers lisa page and peter strzok?  blaming samsung!
cryin’ chuck schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no wall, there is no daca. we must have safety and security, together with a strong military, for our great people!
tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in america. there has never been anything like it. now disney, j.p. morgan chase and many others. massive regulation reduction and tax cuts are making us a powerhouse again. long way to go! jobs, jobs, jobs!

thank you for the wonderful welcome wef! davos2018 
thank you to brandon judd of the national border patrol council for his strong statement on foxandfriends that we very badly need the wall. must also end loophole of “catch &amp; release” and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border now for safety &amp; security reasons.
on holocaust remembrance day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent jewish men, women and children, and the millions of others who perished in the evil nazi genocide. we pledge with all of our might and resolve: never again!  
taliban targeted innocent afghans, brave police in kabul today. our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, and first responders. we will not allow the taliban to win!
i have offered daca a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp; a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) because the republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) to show that democrats do not want to solve daca, only use it!
democrats are not interested in border safety &amp; security or in the funding and rebuilding of our military. they are only interested in obstruction!
somebody please inform jay-z that because of my policies, black unemployment has just been reported to be at the lowest rate ever recorded!
our economy is better than it has been in many decades. businesses are coming back to america like never before. chrysler, as an example, is leaving mexico and coming back to the usa. unemployment is nearing record lows. we are on the right track!
congratulations to america’s new secretary of hhsgov, alex azar! 
join me live for the sotu 
heading to beautiful west virginia to be with great members of the republican party. will be planning infrastructure and discussing immigration and daca, not easy when we have no support from the democrats. not one dem voted for our tax cut bill! need more republicans in ‘18.
march 5th is rapidly approaching and the democrats are doing nothing about daca. they resist, blame, complain and obstruct - and do nothing. start pushing nancy pelosi and the dems to work out a daca fix, now!
thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the state of the union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. foxnews beat every other network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. delivered from the heart!
the democrats just aren’t calling about daca. nancy pelosi and chuck schumer have to get moving fast, or they’ll disappoint you again. we have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the dems! march 5th is coming up fast.
the top leadership and investigators of the fbi and the justice department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of democrats and against republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. rank &amp; file are great people!

rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than i had in winning the election, and higher than certain “sacred cows.” other trump polls are way up also. so why does the media refuse to write this? oh well, someday!
this memo totally vindicates “trump” in probe. but the russian witch hunt goes on and on. their was no collusion and there was no obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing, collusion is dead). this is an american disgrace!
great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. only russia, russia, russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is no collusion!
“the four page memo released friday reports the disturbing fact about how the fbi and fisa appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....the fbi failed to inform the fisa court that the clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the fbi became....
...a tool of anti-trump political actors. this is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the fbi to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....the fbi wasn’t straight with congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.” wall street journal
my thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in south carolina. thank you to our incredible first responders for the work they’ve done!
congratulations to the philadelphia eagles on a great super bowl victory!
the democrats are pushing for universal healthcare while thousands of people are marching in the uk because their u system is going broke and not working. dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. no thanks!
thank you to foxandfriends for exposing the truth. perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!
little adam schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in washington, right up there with comey, warner, brennan and clapper! adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. must be stopped!
any deal on daca that does not include strong border security and the desperately needed wall is a total waste of time. march 5th is rapidly approaching and the dems seem not to care about daca. make a deal!
representative devin nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a great american hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!
thanks to the historic tax cuts that i signed into law, your paychecks are going way up, your taxes are going way down, and america is once again open for business! 
so disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed colts linebacker edwin jackson. this is just one of many such preventable tragedies. we must get the dems to get tough on the border, and with illegal immigration, fast!
my prayers and best wishes are with the family of edwin jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. colts
polling shows nearly 7 in 10 americans support an immigration reform package that includes daca, fully secures the border, ends chain migration &amp; cancels the visa lottery. if d’s oppose this deal, they aren’t serious about daca-they just want open borders. 
we need a 21st century merit-based immigration system.  chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. 
today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of ms-13, and the reforms we need from congress to defeat it. watch here:  
happy birthday to our 40th president of the united states of america, ronald reagan! 
congratulations elonmusk and spacex on the successful falconheavy launch. this achievement, along with nasa’s commercial and international partners, continues to show american ingenuity at its best!

wow! -senator mark warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a russian oligarch. warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in london) he requested with steele of fraudulent dossier fame. all tied into crooked hillary.
just signed bill. our military will now be stronger than ever before. we love and need our military and gave them everything — and more. first time this has happened in a long time. also means jobs, jobs, jobs!
without more republicans in congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our military. sadly, we needed some dem votes for passage. must elect more republicans in 2018 election!
costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more republicans in the 2018 election, and beyond. this bill is a big victory for our military, but much waste in order to get dem votes. fortunately, daca not included in this bill, negotiations to start now!
jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!
the democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the white house for lack of transparency. told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
according to the nytimes, a russian sold phony secrets on “trump” to the u.s. asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. i hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. it is all now starting to come out - drain the swamp!
peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. some are true and some are false. some are old and some are new. there is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. is there no such thing any longer as due process?
“my view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clinton/dnc dossier, it shows that he’s been victimized. he’s been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of.......
....agencies, not just the fbi &amp; doj, now the state department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the election. comey had conversations with donald trump, which i don’t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” tom fitton of judicial watch on foxnews
republicans want to fix daca far more than the democrats do. the dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about daca. they only want to use it as a campaign issue. vote republican!
my thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the westervillepd. 
my administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. congress must secure the immigration system and protect americans. 
so many positive things going on for the u.s.a. and the fake news media just doesn’t want to go there. same negative stories over and over again! no wonder the people no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    maga
4.2 million hard working americans have already received a large bonus and/or pay increase because of our recently passed tax cut &amp; jobs bill....and it will only get better! we are far ahead of schedule.
rep. lou barletta, a great republican from pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a fantastic senator. he is strong &amp; smart, loves pennsylvania &amp; loves our country! voted for tax cuts, unlike bob casey, who listened to tax hikers pelosi and schumer!
just spoke to johnkasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from westervillepd. this is a true tragedy!
this will be a big week for infrastructure. after so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the middle east, it is now time to start investing in our country!
thank you to sue kruczek, who lost her wonderful and talented son nick to the opioid scourge, for your kind words while on foxandfriends. we are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - nick will not have died in vain!
the journey to maga began cpac 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something i look forward to every year. see you at cpac2018!
our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the democrats. after many years we have taken care of our military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. bipartisan, make deal dems?
negotiations on daca have begun. republicans want to make a deal and democrats say they want to make a deal. wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the daca puzzle. this will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! march 5th.
as we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of african-americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. proclamation:  
today, i was honored to be joined by republicans and democrats from both the house and senate, as well as members of my cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore america’s depleted infrastructure.  
my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting. no child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school.
just spoke to governor rick scott. we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting.
so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!
while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca, they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa!
in times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.  
the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. dhsgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in america.” it creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn’t build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa...
...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants. voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement, and a vote for open borders. if dems are actually serious about daca, they should support the grassley bill!
presidential proclamation honoring the victims of the tragedy in parkland, florida:  
i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. am also working with congress on many fronts.
cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democrats...totally abandoned! republicans are still working hard.
russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014, long before i announced that i would run for president. the results of the election were not impacted. the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
our entire nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims &amp; their families in parkland, fl. to teachers, law enforcement, first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: we thank you for your courage!  
melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county, florida. will never forget them, or the evening!
“charges deal don a big win,” written by michael goodwin of the nypost, succinctly states that “the russians had no impact on the election results.” there was no collusion with the trump campaign. “she lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. case closed.”
deputy a.g. rod rosenstein stated at the news conference: “there is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
funny how the fake news media doesn’t want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for president. maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn’t know!
the fake news media never fails. hard to ignore this fact from the vice president of facebook ads, rob goldman! 
“i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goal.” rob goldman vice president of facebook ads 
just like they don’t want to solve the daca problem, why didn’t the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house &amp; senate during the obama administration. because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!
very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter. this is not acceptable. they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion. get back to the basics and make us all proud!
general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h, the dnc and the dems. remember the dirty dossier, uranium, speeches, emails and the podesta company!
never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $1.7 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress, the fbi or justice called for an investigation!
finally, liddle’ adam schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election. he is finally right about something. obama was president, knew of the threat, and did nothing. thank you adam!
i never said russia did not meddle in the election, i said “it may be russia, or china or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” the russian “hoax” was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!
now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats, lead by their fearless leader, crooked hillary clinton, lost the 2016 election. but wasn’t i a great candidate?
if it was the goal of russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the u.s. then, with all of the committee hearings, investigations and party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. they are laughing their asses off in moscow. get smart america!
the fake news of big ratings loser cnn. 
great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot. big gain over last 4 weeks. i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans, the cuts the dems want to take away. we need more republicans!
thank you to kenstarr, former independent counsel, whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse, russian meddling etc. really great interview with mariabartiromo
my great friends from nascar are having their big race today, the daytona 500. brian france and the france family are special people. enjoy the race!
just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey, who at one point i knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 minutes. the questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!
have a great, but very reflective, president’s day!
obama was president up to, and beyond, the 2016 election. so why didn’t he do something about russian meddling?
.mittromney has announced he is running for the senate from the wonderful state of utah. he will make a great senator and worthy successor to orrinhatch, and has my full support and endorsement!
the u.s. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. the unemployment numbers are looking great, and regulations &amp; taxes have been massively cut! jobs, jobs, jobs
“the faith of donald trump,” a book just out by david brody and scott lamb, is a very interesting read. enjoy!
thank you to foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia, including crimea, syria and so much more. we are now starting to win again!
“there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig america’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so i’d invite mr. trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” .....
....the president obama quote just before election. that’s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” when i easily won the electoral college, the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems.
republicans are now leading the generic poll, perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away. actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. also, they want to do nothing on daca, r’s want to fix!
matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event. big difference from those days when president obama held the white house. you’ve come a long way matt!
hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” congressional map, all the way to the supreme court, if necessary. your original was correct! don’t let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!
i have been much tougher on russia than obama, just look at the facts. total fake news!
a woman i don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago. never happened! who would do this in a public space with live security......
....cameras running. another false accusation. why doesn’t washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? one had her home mortgage paid off. only foxnews so reported...doesn’t fit the mainstream media narrative.
main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law. "this shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses." 
bad ratings cnn &amp; msnbc got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall. they probably knew it was fake news but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!
so true, thank you! 
cnn msnbc whether we are republican or democrat, we must now focus on strengthening background checks!
question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration, right up to january 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff session!
the great billy graham is dead. there was nobody like him! he will be missed by christians and all religions. a very special man.
question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration, right up to january 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff sessions!
yesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the medal of valor. americanheroes 
.flotus melania and i join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of billy graham. our prayers are with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with reverend graham in his lifelong ministry. 
i will always remember the time i spent today with courageous students, teachers and families. so much love in the midst of so much pain. we must not let them down. we must keep our children safe!!  full listening session:  
i never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on fake news cnn &amp; nbc. what i said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. far more assets at much less cost than guards. a “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. attacks would end!
....history shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. it takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. great deterrent!
....if a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will never attack that school. cowards won’t go there...problem solved. must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!
i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health. raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks! congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - i hope!
what many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that wayne, chris and the folks who work so hard at the nra are great people and great american patriots. they love our country and will do the right thing.                  make america great again!
will be meeting with lawmakers today at 11:30 a.m. to discuss school safety.  next week it will be with our nation’s governors. it’s been many years of all talk, no action. we’ll get it done!
on behalf of an entire nation, congratulations to the u.s. women's hockey team on winning the gold! goteamusa olympics 
today, it was my great honor to host a school safety roundtable at the whitehouse with state and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials.  there is nothing more important than protecting our children. they deserve to be safe, and we will deliver! 
“school shooting survivor says he quit cnn town hall after refusing scripted question.” tuckercarlson. just like so much of cnn, fake news. that’s why their ratings are so bad! msnbc may be worse.
ms-13 gang members are being removed by our great ice and border patrol agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from el salvador, and through mexico, like water. el salvador just takes our money, and mexico must help more with this problem. we need the wall!
cpac today!
my daughter, ivanka, just arrived in south korea. we cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country.
for those of you who are still interested, the democrats have totally forgotten about daca. not a lot of interest on this subject from them!
after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride! cpac2018 
we salute our great american flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and we all proudly stand for the national anthem. cpac2018 
our nation’s motto is in god we trust. this week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean. we will never forget the historic crowds, the voice, the energy, and the profound faith of billy graham! cpac2018 
today, flotus melania and i were honored to welcome prime minister turnbullmalcolm and mrs. turnbull of australia to the whitehouse!  press conference:  
thank you to the great men and women of the united states secretservice for a job well done!
so true wayne, and lowest black unemployment in history! 
armed educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. very smart people. must be firearms adept &amp; have annual training. should get yearly bonus. shootings will not happen again - a big &amp; very inexpensive deterrent. up to states.
democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great state of pennsylvania. foxnews. this is very unfair to republicans and to our country as a whole. must be appealed to the united states supreme court asap!
unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing regulations!
dems are no longer talking daca! “out of sight, out of mind,” they say. daca beneficiaries should not be happy. nancy pelosi truly doesn’t care about them. republicans stand ready to make a deal!
big cpac straw poll results: 93% approve of the job president trump is doing (thank you!). 50% say president trump should tweet more or same (funny!). 79% say republicans in congress should do a better job of working with president trump (starting to happen).
the democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal bust. just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. so illegal!
dem memo: fbi did not disclose who the clients were - the clinton campaign and the dnc. wow!
“russians had no compromising information on donald trump” foxnews  of course not, because there is none, and never was. this whole witch hunt is an illegal disgrace...and obama did nothing about russia!
“congressman schiff omitted and distorted key facts” foxnews  so, what else is new. he is a total phony!
i will be interviewed by judgejeanine on foxnews at 9:00 p.m. enjoy!
“he’s got a very good point. somebody in the justice department has a treasure trove of evidence of mrs. clinton’s criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated. i fully agree with the president on that.” judgenapolitano on marthamaccallum show
“i’ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. i just don’t see the evidence....in terms of the collusion, it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.”  jonathan turley on foxnews
“we’ve seen no evidence of collusion....i have seen nothing, the firing of james comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the president has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the president of the u.s. i just don’t see it.”  judge ken starr
witch hunt!
i want to encourage all of my many texas friends to vote in the primary for governor greg abbott, senator ted cruz, lt. gov. dan patrick, and attorney general ken paxton. they are helping me to make america great again! vote early or on march 6th.
“american consumers are the most confident they've been since 2000....a strong job market is boosting confidence. the unemployment rate has stayed at a 17-year low.” 
texas lc george p. bush backed me when it wasn’t the politically correct thing to do, and i back him now. also, ac sid miller has been with me from the beginning, he is “trump’s man in texas.” also support comptroller glenn hegar, and railroad commissioner christi craddick.
.senatorwicker of mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive tax cut bill done and approved. also big help on cutting regs. i am with him in his re-election all the way!
such a beautiful map, thank you! 
big legal win today. u.s. judge sided with the trump administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great border wall on the southern border. now this important project can go forward!
the heritage foundation has just stated that 64% of the trump agenda is already done, faster than even ronald reagan. “we’re blown away,” said thomas binion of heritage, president trump “is very active, very conservative and very effective. huge volume &amp; spectrum of issues.”
i have decided that sections of the wall that california wants built now will not be built until the whole wall is approved. big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. our country must have border security!
45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. ice and border patrol agents are doing a great job for our country. ms-13 thugs being hit hard.
why is a.g. jeff sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive fisa abuse. will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on comey etc. isn’t the i.g. an obama guy? why not use justice department lawyers? disgraceful!
today, in the center of this great chamber lies billy graham – an ambassador for christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of god’s grace. 
starting at a small bible school in florida, billy graham soon led a nationwide revival. from a large tent in los angeles, to one hundred thousand people in a single day at yankee stadium, to more than two million people at madison square garden over sixteen weeks in 1957... 
today we honor billy graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored.   we say a prayer for our country: that all across this land, the lord will raise up men and women like billy graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of god. 
it was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of congress for a discussion on safe schools and safe communities. as we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in parkland, we are determined to turn our grief into action. full meeting:  
many ideas, some good &amp; some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the white house. background checks a big part of conversation. gun free zones are proven targets of killers. after many years, a bill should emerge. respect 2nd amendment!
our steel and aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. we must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. we want free, fair and smart trade!
unemployment filings are at their lowest level in over 48 years. great news for workers and jobs, jobs, jobs! maga 
“manufacturing in u.s. expands at fastest pace since may 2004” 
“consumer confidence in february highest since november 2000” 
together, we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need. working together, we will defeat this opioidepidemic. full opioid summit:

manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in almost two decades!
good (great) meeting in the oval office tonight with the nra!
alex baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on snl, now says playing djt was agony for him. alex, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. you were terrible. bring back darrell hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent!
when a country (usa) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. it’s easy!
alec baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on snl, now says playing me was agony. alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. bring back darrell hammond, funnier and a far greater talent!
eric, we are all with you and your family! look forward to seeing you back on t.v. 
we must protect our country and our workers. our steel industry is in bad shape. if you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country!
when a country taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we tax the same product coming into our country at zero, not fair or smart. we will soon be starting reciprocal taxes so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 billion trade deficit-have no choice!
rest in peace billy graham! 
heading to billy graham funeral. a special man!
happy national anthem day! 
mainstream media in u.s. is being mocked all over the world. they’ve gone crazy! 
the united states has an $800 billion dollar yearly trade deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. they laugh at what fools our leaders have been. no more!
if the e.u. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on u.s. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a tax on their cars which freely pour into the u.s. they make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. big trade imbalance!
the gridiron dinner last night was great fun. i am accomplishing a lot in washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the american people!
we are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the u.s. for many years. our steel and aluminum industries are dead. sorry, it’s time for a change! make america great again!
we have large trade deficits with mexico and canada. nafta, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for u.s.a. massive relocation of companies &amp; jobs. tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new &amp; fair nafta agreement is signed. also, canada must..
...treat our farmers much better. highly restrictive. mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the u.s. they have not done what needs to be done. millions of people addicted and dying.
to protect our country we must protect american steel! america first
why did the obama administration start an investigation into the trump campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the election in november? wanted to discredit so crooked h would win. unprecedented. bigger than watergate! plus, obama did nothing about russian meddling.
it’s march 5th and the democrats are nowhere to be found on daca. gave them 6 months, they just don’t care. where are they? we are ready to make a deal!
the new fake news narrative is that there is chaos in the white house. wrong! people will always come &amp; go, and i want strong dialogue before making a final decision. i still have some people that i want to change (always seeking perfection). there is no chaos, only great energy!
total inaction on daca by dems. where are you? a deal can be made!
we are getting it done - jobs and security! 
we will see what happens! 
lowest rated oscars in history. problem is, we don’t have stars anymore - except your president (just kidding, of course)!
federal judge in maryland has just ruled that “president trump has the right to end daca.” president obama had 8 years to fix this problem, and didn’t. i am waiting for the dems, they are running for the hills!
possible progress being made in talks with north korea. for the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. the world is watching and waiting! may be false hope, but the u.s. is ready to go hard in either direction!
will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new chief economic advisor. many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!
great couple, great book!

we are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our veterans.
chinese president xi xinping and i spoke at length about the meeting with kim jong un of north korea. president xi told me he appreciates that the u.s. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. china continues to be helpful!

spoke to prime minister abe of japan, who is very enthusiastic about talks with north korea. also discussing opening up japan to much better trade with the u.s. currently have a massive $100 billion trade deficit. not fair or sustainable. it will all work out!
heading to moon township, pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, state representative rick saccone, who is running for congress. big &amp; happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever). rick will help me a lot. also, tough on crime &amp; border. loves 2nd a &amp; vets
north korea has not conducted a missile test since november 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. i believe they will honor that commitment!
in the first hours after hearing that north korea’s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled &amp; amazed.they couldn’t believe it. but by the following morning the news became fake.they said so what, who cares!
the european union, wonderful countries who treat the u.s. very badly on trade, are complaining about the tariffs on steel &amp; aluminum. if they drop their horrific barriers &amp; tariffs on u.s. products going in, we will likewise drop ours. big deficit. if not, we tax cars etc. fair!
join me live in moon township, pennsylvania at 7:00pme. great crowd for a maga rally! 
epic crowd in moon township, pennsylvania tonight. thank you! get out on tuesday and vote for rick saccone4pa18. together, we are making america great again! 
the failing new york times purposely wrote a false story stating that i am unhappy with my legal team on the russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. wrong. i am very happy with my lawyers, john dowd, ty cobb and jay sekulow. they are doing a great job and.....
...have shown conclusively that there was no collusion with russia..just excuse for losing. the only collusion was that done by the dnc, the democrats and crooked hillary. the writer of the story, maggie haberman, a hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.
the republicans are 5-0 in recent congressional races, a point which the fake news media continuously fails to mention. i backed and campaigned for all of the winners. they give me credit for one. hopefully, rick saccone will be another big win on tuesday.
the democrats continue to obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...a record in u.s. history. state department, ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. senate must approve now!
rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are “somewhat low.” they know they are lying when they say it. turn off the show - fake news!
secretary of commerce wilbur ross will be speaking with representatives of the european union about eliminating the large tariffs and barriers they use against the u.s.a. not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.
very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by white house. legislation moving forward. bump stocks will soon be out. highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to state law. armed guards ok, deterrent!.......
....on 18 to 21 age limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. states are making this decision. things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly).
if schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!
the pittsburgh post gazette just endorsed rick saccone for congress. he will be much better for steel and business. very strong on experience and what our country needs. lamb will always vote for pelosi and dems....will raise taxes, weak on crime and border.
it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 world series champion houston astros to the whitehouse! houstonstrong 
the house intelligence committee has, after a 14 month long in-depth investigation, found no evidence of collusion or coordination between the trump campaign and russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.
the economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better. jobs and wages up. vote for rick saccone and keep it going!
mike pompeo, director of the cia, will become our new secretary of state. he will do a fantastic job! thank you to rex tillerson for his service! gina haspel will become the new director of the cia, and the first woman so chosen. congratulations to all!
heading to see the border wall prototypes in california! 
“according to the center for immigration studies, the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime, drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole...” 
california’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. thousands of dangerous &amp; violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent americans. this must stop!
if we don’t have a wall system, we’re not going to have a country. congress must fund the border wall &amp; prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country &amp; the people of our country. we must enforce our laws &amp; protect our people! buildthewall 
it was my great honor to deliver a message at the marine core air station miramar to our great u.s. military, straight from the heart of the american people: we support you, we thank you, we love you - and we will always have your back! 
it was my great honor to deliver a message at the marine corps air station miramar to our great u.s. military, straight from the heart of the american people: we support you, we thank you, we love you - and we will always have your back! 
all across this nation, we pray for our country and we thank god for our united states marines! thank you. god bless you. and god bless america! 
hundreds of good people, including very important ambassadors and judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the democrats in the senate. many important positions in government are unfilled because of this obstruction. worst in u.s. history!
perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of u.s. companies been better than they are today!
five of our incredible cabinet secretaries are testifying on the hill this morning on the need to rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. we need to build fast &amp; we need to build for our future. thank you senatecommerce for hosting this hearing! infrastructureinamerica
we cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our country!
thank you for hosting! maga 
today the house took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the stop school violence act. we must put the safety of america's children first by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. a tragedy like parkland can't happen ever again!
together, we are making america great again! 
it was wonderful to be back in missouri where our push for historic tax cuts all began. six months ago i promised that we would cut taxes to bring main street roaring back - and that is exactly what is happening! 
please join me with your thoughts and prayers for both aviators, their families and our incredible usnavy. 
larry kudlow will be my chief economic advisor as director of the national economic council. our country will have many years of great economic &amp; financial success, with low taxes, unparalleled innovation, fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way! maga
we do have a trade deficit with canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). p.m. justin trudeau of canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that canada has a surplus vs. the u.s.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how i know!
it was my honor to welcome prime minister leo varadkar of ireland to the whitehouse! 
continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at fiu - so tragic. many brave first responders rushed in to save lives. thank you for your courage. praying this evening for all who are affected.
“president donald j. trump delivers remarks at the shamrock☘️bowl presentation by prime minister varadkar in the east room of the white house”  
our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the iraq-syria border yesterday. their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten.
it would be great for the republican party of nevada, and it’s unity if good guy danny tarkanian would run for congress and dean heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for senate unopposed!
“u.s. consumer confidence hits 14-year high” 
andrew mccabe fired, a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi - a great day for democracy. sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy. he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi!
happy stpatricksday 
as the house intelligence committee has concluded, there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign. as many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi, justice &amp; state. draintheswamp
the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught, called out and fired. how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by crooked h friend, terry m, who was also under investigation? how many lies? how many leaks? comey knew it all, and much more!
the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc, and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign. witch hunt!
wow, watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” he said strongly “never, no.” he lied as shown clearly on foxandfriends.
spent very little time with andrew mccabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. i don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. same with lying james comey. can we call them fake memos?
why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats, some big crooked hillary supporters, and zero republicans? another dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? and yet, there is no collusion!
.seanhannity on foxandfriends now! great! 8:18 a.m.
a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest!
the democrats do not want to help daca. would be so easy to make a deal!
our nation was founded by farmers. our independence was won by farmers. and our continent was tamed by farmers. our farmers always lead the way -- we are proud of them, and we are delivering for them! nationalagricultureday
austin bombing suspect is dead. great job by law enforcement and all concerned!
department of justice should have urged the supreme court to at least hear the drivers license case on illegal immigrants in arizona. i agree with loudobbs. should have sought review.
“special council is told to find crimes, wether crimes exist or not. i was opposed the the selection of mueller to be special council, i still am opposed to it. i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because.....
...there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice!”  so stated by harvard law professor alan dershowitz.
“special council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not. i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council. i am still opposed to it. i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because.....
i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, obama called him also). the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. they are wrong! getting along with russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......
.....they can help solve problems with north korea, syria, ukraine, isis, iran and even the coming arms race. bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts.” obama and clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember reset). peace through strength!
got $1.6 billion to start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming. most importantly, got $700 billion to rebuild our military, $716 billion next year...most ever. had to waste money on dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.
democrats refused to take care of daca. would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care. i had to fight for military and start of wall.
crazy joe biden is trying to act like a tough guy. actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. he doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. don’t threaten people joe!
remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that donald trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. well, not saying that anymore!
as a candidate, i pledged that if elected i would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect american workers, and defend our national security.  today, we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment.  
my honor charlie - thank you! maga 
i am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, ambjohnbolton will be my new national security advisor. i am very thankful for the service of general h.r. mcmaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend. there will be an official contact handover on 4/9.
house intelligence committee votes to release final report. findings: (1) no evidence provided of collusion between trump campaign &amp; russia. (2)  the obama administrations post election response was insufficient. (3) clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
daca was abandoned by the democrats. very unfair to them! would have been tied to desperately needed wall.
i am considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats (not even mentioned in bill) and the border wall, which is desperately needed for our national defense, is not fully funded.
news conference at the white house concerning the omnibus spending bill.  1:00 p.m.
obama administration legalized bump stocks. bad idea. as i promised, today the department of justice will issue the rule banning bump stocks with a mandated comment period. we will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
as a matter of national security i've signed the omnibus spending bill. i say to congress: i will never sign another bill like this again. to prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, i'm calling on congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills! 
our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in france yesterday, and we grieve the nation’s loss. we also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support. we are with you emmanuelmacron!
france honors a great hero. officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in isis related terror attack. so much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical islamic terrorism. even stronger measures needed, especially at borders!
because of the $700 &amp; $716 billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military, many jobs are created and our military is again rich. building a great border wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our country, is all about national defense. build wall through m!
much can be done with the $1.6 billion given to building and fixing the border wall. it is just a down payment. work will start immediately. the rest of the money will come - and remember daca, the democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!
many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia case...don’t believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. fame &amp; fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. problem is that a new......
....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and i am very happy with my existing team. besides, there was no collusion with russia, except by crooked hillary and the dems!
happy national medalofhonorday to our heroes. we love you! 
“president donald j. trump proclaims march 25, 2018, as greek independence day: a national day of celebration of greek and american democracy”

the economy is looking really good. it has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. the underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.
so much fake news. never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. but through it all, our country is doing great!
great news! maga 
trade talks going on with numerous countries that, for many years, have not treated the united states fairly. in the end, all will be happy!
i am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the president's park in april. i encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic. we will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis! 
the second amendment will never be repealed! as much as democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former supreme court justice stevens, no way. we need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the supreme court!
for years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the korean peninsula was not even a small possibility. now there is a good chance that kim jong un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. look forward to our meeting!
received message last night from xi jinping of china that his meeting with kim jong un went very well and that kim looks forward to his meeting with me. in the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!
.ustraderep just announced an agreement in principle with south korea on korus! a great deal for american and korean workers. let’s now focus on our important security relationship.
my administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in orange county defending their rights against california's illegal and unconstitutional sanctuary policies. california's sanctuary laws....
....release known dangerous criminals into communities across the state. all citizens have the right to be protected by federal law and strong borders.
great briefing this afternoon on the start of our southern border wall! 
i am pleased to announce that i intend to nominate highly respected admiral ronny l. jackson, md, as the new secretary of veterans affairs....
....in the interim, hon. robert wilkie of dod will serve as acting secretary. i am thankful for dr. david shulkin’s service to our country and to our great veterans!
i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election. unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy (causing tremendous loss to the u.s.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!
we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the great state of ohio. a tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site, where the skills of the american worker are forged and refined! 
jobs, jobs, jobs! unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low. together, we are making the economy great again! 
washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. no more! it's time to rebuild, and we will do it with american workers, american grit, and american pride! 

while we are on the subject, it is reported that the u.s. post office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for amazon. that amounts to billions of dollars. the failing n.y. times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that...
...does not include the fake washington post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  register. if the p.o. “increased its parcel rates, amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 billion.” this post office scam must stop. amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!
governor jerry “moonbeam” brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) kidnapping and robbery (2) badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) dealing drugs. is this really what the great people of california want? foxnews
happy easter!
border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal (democrat) laws like catch &amp; release. getting more dangerous. “caravans” coming. republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now. no more daca deal!
mexico is doing very little, if not nothing, at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border, and then into the u.s. they laugh at our dumb immigration laws. they must stop the big drug and people flows, or i will stop their cash cow, nafta. need wall!
these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca. they want in on the act!
mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “caravans” of people enter their country. they must stop them at their northern border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.....
...congress must immediately pass border legislation, use nuclear option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people. border patrol agents (and ice) are great, but the weak dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. act now congress, our country is being stolen!
daca is dead because the democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon... no longer works. must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation. democrats want no borders, hence drugs and crime!
mexico is making a fortune on nafta...they have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. with all of the money they make from the u.s., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until congress changes our immigration laws!
so funny to watch fake news networks, among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with, criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased. sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc, which is a total joke.
only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon. they lose a fortune, and this will be changed. also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!
so sad that the department of “justice” and the fbi are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by congress. an embarrassment to our country!
an honor to host the annual whitehouse easter egg roll! 
“president donald j. trump proclaims april 2, 2018, world autism awareness day” 
as ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from. a whole big wasted procedure must take place. mexico &amp; canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an obama joke. act congress
honduras, mexico and many other countries that the u.s. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies. caravans are heading here. must pass tough laws and build the wall. democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime!
39% of my nominations, including diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to democrat obstruction and delay. at this rate, it would take more than 7 years before i am allowed to have these great people start working. never happened before. disgraceful!
“president trump's approval rate among likely u.s. voters hit 50 percent on monday, which puts him higher than former president barack obama's score at the same point into his first term, according to a new poll.” via: anna_giaritelli dcexaminer 
autismawarenessday lightitupblue 
the fake news networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda, are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast. the “fakers” at cnn, nbc, abc &amp; cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!
the big caravan of people from honduras, now coming across mexico and heading to our “weak laws” border, had better be stopped before it gets there. cash cow nafta is in play, as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. congress must act now!
check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged cnn unless you state that you are totally anti-trump? little jeff zuker, whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately. they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting!
thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling. just hit 50%, which is higher than cheatin’ obama at the same time in his administration.
i am right about amazon costing the united states post office massive amounts of money for being their delivery boy. amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the american taxpayer. many billions of dollars. p.o. leaders don’t have a clue (or do they?)!
today, it was my honor to welcome estonia president kerstikaljulaid, lithuania president grybauskaite_lt, and latvia president vejonis to the whitehouse. congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence! balticsummit:  
we will protect our southern border! 
was just briefed on the shooting at youtube’s hq in san bruno, california. our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. thank you to our phenomenal law enforcement officers and first responders that are currently on the scene.
our border laws are very weak while those of mexico &amp; canada are very strong. congress must change these obama era, and other, laws now! the democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....crime! we will be taking strong action today.
we are not in a trade war with china, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the u.s. now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year, with intellectual property theft of another $300 billion. we cannot let this continue!
when you’re already $500 billion down, you can’t lose!
our thoughts and prayers are with the four u.s. marines from the 3rd marine aircraft wing who lost their lives in yesterday’s southern california helicopter crash. we pray for their families, and our great usmc.
today we honor dr. martin luther king, jr. on the 50th anniversary of his assassination. earlier this year i spoke about dr. king’s legacy of justice and peace, and his impact on uniting americans. mlk50 proclamation:  
“still rising: rasmussen poll shows donald trump approval ratings now at 51 percent” 
the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border. because of the trump administrations actions, border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low. stop drugs!
the fake news washington post, amazon’s “chief lobbyist,” has another (of many) phony headlines, “trump defiant as china adds trade penalties.” wrong! should read, “trump defiant as u.s. adds trade penalties, will end barriers and massive  i.p. theft.” typically bad reporting!
thanks to our historic tax cuts, america is open for business, and millions of american workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages, salaries and bonuses! 
thank you wvgovernor jim justice. it was my great honor to be with the amazing people of west virginia today! maga 
despite the aluminum tariffs, aluminum prices are down 4%. people are surprised, i’m not! lots of money coming into u.s. coffers and jobs, jobs, jobs!
china, which is a great economic power, is considered a developing nation within the world trade organization. they therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the u.s. does anybody think this is fair. we were badly represented. the wto is unfair to u.s.
do you believe that the fake news media is pushing hard on a story that i am going to replace a.g. jeff sessions with epa chief scott pruitt, who is doing a great job but is totally under siege? do people really believe this stuff? so much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!
america is open for business!

the united states hasn’t had a trade surplus with china in 40 years. they must end unfair trade, take down barriers and charge only reciprocal tariffs. the u.s. is losing $500 billion a year, and has been losing billions of dollars for decades. cannot continue!
we are sealing up our southern border. the people of our great country want safety and security. the dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!
lawmakers of the house judiciary committee are angrily accusing the department of justice of missing the thursday deadline for turning over unredacted documents relating to fisa abuse, fbi, comey, lynch, mccabe, clinton emails and much more. slow walking - what is going on? bad!
what does the department of justice and fbi have to hide? why aren’t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the house judiciary committee? stalling, but for what reason? not looking good!
fire at trump tower is out. very confined (well built building). firemen (and women) did a great job. thank you!
while security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, scott pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at epa. record clean air &amp; water while saving usa billions of dollars. rent was about market rate, travel expenses ok. scott is doing a great job!

president xi and i will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. china will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do. taxes will become reciprocal &amp; a deal will be made on intellectual property. great future for both countries!
many dead, including women and children, in mindless chemical attack in syria. area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. president putin, russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad. big price...
....to pay. open area immediately for medical help and verification. another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. sick!
if president obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand, the syrian disaster would have ended long ago! animal assad would have been history!
congratulations to patrick reed on his great and courageous masters win! when patrick had his amazing win at doral 5 years ago, people saw his great talent, and a bright future ahead. now he is the masters champion!
when a car is sent to the united states from china, there is a tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. when a car is sent to china from the united states, there is a tariff to be paid of 25%. does that sound like free or fair trade.  no, it sounds like stupid trade -  going on for years!
the democrats are not doing what’s right for our country. i will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law! 
great cabinet meeting at the whitehouse this morning!  
attorney–client privilege is dead!

the failing new york times wrote another phony story. it was political pundit doug schoen, not a ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (skype), hosted by doug, in ukraine. i was very positive about ukraine-another negative to the fake russia  c story!
so much fake news about what is going on in the white house. very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china, the coming north korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in syria. feels great to have bolton &amp; larry k on board. i (we) are
....doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. no collusion or obstruction (other than i fight back), so now they do the unthinkable, and raid a lawyers office for information! bad!
russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria. get ready russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” you shouldn’t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the cold war. there is no reason for this. russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. stop the arms race?
much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake &amp; corrupt russia investigation, headed up by the all democrat loyalists, or people that worked for obama. mueller is most conflicted of all (except rosenstein who signed fisa &amp; comey letter). no collusion, so they go crazy!
speaker paul ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. we are with you paul!
the whitehouse is partnering with interior and natlparkservice to bring the nscsafety's “prescribed to death” opioid memorial to the ellipse - beginning tomorrow, april 12th to april 18th. more information:  
“trump just took a giant step towards actual welfare reform” 
honored to have republican congressional leadership join me at the whitehouse this evening. lots to discuss as we continue making america great again! 
big show tonight on seanhannity! 9:00 p.m. on foxnews
if i wanted to fire robert mueller in december, as reported by the failing new york times, i would have fired him. just more fake news from a biased newspaper!
california governor jerry brown is doing the right thing and sending the national guard to the border. thank you jerry, good move for the safety of our country!
never said when an attack on syria would take place. could be very soon or not so soon at all! in any event, the united states, under my administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of isis. where is our “thank you america?”
good luck to mike pompeo during his confirmation hearing today. he will be a great secretary of state!
on yom hashoah we remember the six million jews slaughtered in the holocaust. with each passing year, our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge neveragain. holocaustremembranceday 
i have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with robert mueller (unlike the clintons!). i have full confidence in ty cobb, my special counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.
just had an agricultural roundtable with memembers of congress and governors.  i will be making remarks on the large scale tax cuts given to american families and workers at 1:45 p.m. from the rose garden. join me live:  
thank you to all of the american workers who travelled here today! this event is dedicated to you: the hardworking americans who make this nation run. you love your country, you provide for your family, you have pride in your work and you cherish our great american flag! taxcuts 
america’s greatest treasure is our people – and my administration hears your voice and has your back. we are fighting to give every american a future of dignity, purpose and pride. american spirit is back! taxcuts 
would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres. obama. we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations, japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!
tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities. started the wall in san diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. they will soon be protected!
james comey is a proven leaker &amp; liar. virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. he leaked classified information, for which he should be prosecuted. he lied to congress under oath. he is a weak and.....
....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible director of the fbi. his handling of the crooked hillary clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history. it was my great honor to fire james comey!
we are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: made in the usa! 
doj just issued the mccabe report - which is a total disaster. he lied! lied! lied! mccabe was totally controlled by comey - mccabe is comey!! no collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!

a perfectly executed strike last night. thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military. could not have had a better result. mission accomplished!
so proud of our great military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our country has ever had. there won’t be anything, or anyone, even close!
unbelievably, james comey states that polls, where crooked hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the clinton email probe. in other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. slimeball!
the big questions in comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up classified information (jail), why did he lie to congress (jail), why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi (why didn’t they take it), why the phony memos, mccabe’s $700,000 &amp; more?
comey throws ag lynch “under the bus!” why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch? was she promised a supreme court seat, or ag, in order to lay off hillary. no golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term “mission accomplished.” i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term, it should be brought back. use often!
i never asked comey for personal loyalty. i hardly even knew this guy. just another of his many lies. his “memos” are self serving and fake!
attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past. i have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. all lawyers are deflated and concerned!
slippery james comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the worst fbi director in history, by far!
just hit 50% in the rasmussen poll, much higher than president obama at same point. with all of the phony stories and fake news, it’s hard to believe! thank you america, we are doing great things.
comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in congress to senator g), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. disgruntled, he, mccabe, and the others, committed many crimes!
russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the u.s. keeps raising interest rates. not acceptable!
employment is up, taxes are down. enjoy!
i am in florida and looking forward to my meeting with prime minister abe of japan. working on trade and military security.
looks like jerry brown and california are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border. he cannot come to terms for the national guard to patrol and protect the border. the high crime rate will only get higher. much wanted wall in san diego already started!
so many people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut bill. everyone is talking, really nice to see!
getting ready to meet prime minister abe of japan, a truly fine gentleman!
rasmussen just came out at 51% approval despite the fake news media. they were one of the three most accurate on election day. just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc news/washington post, and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters). much of the media is a scam!
welcome prime minister abe! 
today’s court decision means that congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons. this is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by....
....congress – house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. keep america safe!
states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!
.flotus melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush: 
.flotus melania and i join the nation in celebrating the life of barbara bush: 
it is my great honor to host jpn_pmo abeshinzo! 
pastor andrew brunson, a fine gentleman and christian leader in the united states, is on trial and being persecuted in turkey for no reason. they call him a spy, but i am more a spy than he is. hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!
while japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp, i don’t like the deal for the united states. too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for our workers. look how bad wto is to u.s.
there is a revolution going on in california. soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous, crime infested &amp; breeding concept. jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border, but the people of the state are not happy. want security &amp; safety now!
a sketch years later about a nonexistent man. a total con job, playing the fake news media for fools (but they know it)! 
mike pompeo met with kim jong un in north korea last week. meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. details of summit are being worked out now. denuclearization will be a great thing for world, but also for north korea!
slippery james comey, the worst fbi director in history, was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where, by the way, there was no collusion (except by the dems)!
best wishes to prime minister netanyahu and all of the people of israel on the 70th anniversary of your great independence. we have no better friends anywhere. looking forward to moving our embassy to jerusalem next month!
prime minister abeshinzo of japan and myself this morning building an even deeper and better relationship while playing a quick round of golf at trump international golf club. 
great working luncheon with u.s. and japanese delegations this afternoon! 
it was my great honor to host my friend jpn_pmo abeshinzo and his delegation at mar-a-lago for the past two days. lots accomplished, thank you! success 
great meeting with prime minister abe of japan, who has just left florida. talked in depth about north korea, military and trade. good things will happen!
thank you san diego county for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against california's illegal and unconstitutional 'sanctuary' policies. california's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all americans at risk.
governor jerry brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 national guard troops” to do nothing. the crime rate in california is high enough, and the federal government will not be paying for governor brown’s charade. we need border security and action, not words!
just arrived naskeywest! heading to a briefing with the joint interagency task force south, northcom and southcom. 
thank you jiatfsouth, norad_northcom, southcomwatch and dhsgov. keep up the great work! 
.marshablackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. great on the military, border security and crime. loves and works hard for the people of tennessee. she has my full endorsement and i will be there to campaign with her!
democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government, hence, the american people. they are “slow walking” all of my nominations - hundreds of people. at this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!
...hopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors, judges and the people who make washington work are approved. the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our country!
mike pompeo is outstanding. first in his class at west point. a top student at harvard law school. a success at whatever he has done. we need the senate to approve mike asap. he will be a great secretary of state!
my thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two gcsoflorida deputies (heroes) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.
sanctuary cities released at least 142 gang members across the united states, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. we are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in america difficult!
james comey just threw andrew mccabe “under the bus.” inspector general’s report on mccabe is a disaster for both of them! getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?
james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction. also, he leaked classified information. wow! will the witch hunt continue?
so general michael flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while shadey james comey can leak and lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). is that really the way life in america is supposed to work? i don’t think so!
so exciting! i have agreed to be the commencement speaker at our great naval academy on may 25th in annapolis, maryland. looking forward to being there.
nancy pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big tax cuts given to the american people by the republicans...got not one democrat vote! here’s a choice. they want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!
looks like opec is at it again. with record amounts of oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, oil prices are artificially very high! no good and will not be accepted!
can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the fake news media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest poll numbers, including those on election day? the american public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. make america great again!
just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats. this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi, the wendy wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails.
north korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site. this is very good news for north korea and the world - big progress! look forward to our summit.
just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist democrats. this can be good news in that we will now counter for the dnc server that they refused to give to the fbi, the debbie wasserman schultz servers and documents held by the pakistani mystery man and clinton emails.
james comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special council? therefore, the special council was established based on an illegal act? really, does everybody know what that means?
a message from kim jong un: “north korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.” also will “shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.” progress being made for all!
the new york times and a third rate reporter named maggie habberman, known as a crooked h flunkie who i don’t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy michael cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will “flip.” they use....
....non-existent “sources” and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who i have always liked &amp; respected. most people will flip if the government lets them out of trouble, even if....
....it means lying or making up stories. sorry, i don’t see michael doing that despite the horrible witch hunt and the dishonest media!

join me in washington, michigan on saturday, april 28, 2018 at 7:00pm! maga tickets:  
fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in key west, florida. thank you! 
today, my thoughts and prayers are with the entire bush family. in memory of first lady barbara bush, there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the center hall of the whitehouse. 
heading to the southern white house to watch the funeral service of barbara bush. first lady melania has arrived in houston to pay our respects. will be a beautiful day!
so funny, the democrats have sued the republicans for winning. now he r’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including servers and emails!
sylvester stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson. his trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, i am considering a full pardon!
james comey’s memos are classified, i did not declassify them. they belong to our government! therefore, he broke the law! additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said i said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. where are memos on clinton, lynch &amp; others?
the washington post said i refer to jeff sessions as “mr. magoo” and rod rosenstein as “mr. peepers.” this is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” there are no such people and don’t know these characters...just more fake &amp; disgusting news to create ill will!
“at least two memos comey shared with a friend contained classified information.”  wall street journal
“gop lawmakers asking sessions to investigate comey and hillary clinton.” foxnews   good luck with that request!
sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake news nbc just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with north korea, and they have given up nothing. wow, we haven’t given up anything &amp; they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for world), site closure, &amp; no more testing!
....we are a long way from conclusion on north korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won’t - only time will tell....but the work i am doing now should have been done a long time ago!
“i can die happy now with trump job performance,” stated mary matalin. “a great overall president, stunning!” thank you mary.
a complete witch hunt!
funny how all of the pundits that couldn’t come close to making a deal on north korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!
kim strassel of the wsj just said, after reviewing the dumb comey memos, “you got to ask, what was the purpose of the special counsel? there’s no there there.” dan henninger of the wsj said memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!
thank you to the incredible law enforcement officers from the palm beach county sheriff’s office. they keep us safe and are very cool about it! 
hard to believe obstructionists may vote against mike pompeo for secretary of state. the dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the ambassador to germany. they are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before. need more republicans!
despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border being so bad and one sided, i have instructed the secretary of homeland security not to let these large caravans of people into our country. it is a disgrace. we are the only country in the world so naive! wall
mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through mexico and into the u.s. we may make this a condition of the new nafta agreement. our country cannot accept what is happening! also, we must get wall funding fast.
here’s a great stat - since january 2017, the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million. the american people are finally back to work!
having great meetings and discussions with my friend, president emmanuelmacron of france. we are in the midst of meetings on iran, syria and trade. we will be holding a joint press conference shortly, here at the whitehouse.  
americans stand with you and all of canada, prime minister justintrudeau. our thoughts and prayers are with you all. torontostrong 
arizona, please get out today and vote debbielesko for congress in az08. strong on border, immigration and crime. great on the military. time is ticking down - get out and vote today. we need debbie in congress!
“president trump calls the u.s.-france relationship ‘unbreakable.’ history shows he’s right.” 
.jimrenacci has worked so hard on tax reductions, illegal immigration, the border and crime. i need jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep making america great again! he will be a fantastic  senator for the great state of ohio, and has my full endorsement!

today, flotus melania and i were honored to welcome french president emmanuelmacron and mrs. brigitte macron to the whitehouse. we look forward to hosting them at tonight's state dinner, in their honor. 
our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history, culture, and destiny. we are people who cherish our values, protect our civilization, and recognize the image of god in every human soul. 
congratulations to republican debbie lesko on her big win in the special election for arizona house seat. debbie will do a great job! press is so silent.
busy day planned.  looking forward to watching president macron of france address a joint session of congress today. this is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done...he will be great!
.flotus did a spectacular job hosting the president of france emmanuelmacron and his wife brigitte. every detail was done to perfection. the state dining room never looked more beautiful, and washington is abuzz over what an incredible job melania did.
looking forward to my meeting with tim cook of apple. we will be talking about many things, including how the u.s. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade.
thank you kanye, very cool! 
maga! 
i will be interviewed on foxandfriends at 8:00 a.m. enjoy!
loved being on foxandfriends this morning. great show!
the u.s. has put together a strong bid w/ canada &amp; mexico for the 2026 world cup. it would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the u.s. bid. why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the united nations)?
is everybody believing what is going on. james comey can’t define what a leak is. he illegally leaked classified information but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. he lied all over the place to cover it up. he’s either very sick or very dumb. remember sailor!
after a furious year of missile launches and nuclear testing, a historic meeting between north and south korea is now taking place. good things are happening, but only time will tell!
korean war to end! the united states, and all of its great people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in korea!
so great to have staff sgt. dan nevins and the incredible wounded warriors with me in the white house yesterday. these are truly brave and special people! foxandfriends
please do not forget the great help that my good friend, president xi of china, has given to the united states, particularly at the border of north korea. without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!
kanye west has performed a great service to the black community - big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in decades - legacy stuff! thank you also to chance and dr. darrell scott, they really get it (lowest black &amp; hispanic unemployment in history).
look forward to meeting with chancellor angela merkel of germany today. so much to discuss, so little time! it will be good for both of our great countries!
just out: house intelligence committee report released. “no evidence” that the trump campaign “colluded, coordinated or conspired with russia.” clinton campaign paid for opposition research obtained from russia- wow! a total witch hunt! must end now!
i urge all americans to participate in takebackday tomorrow! let’s come together and beat last october’s record of disposed prescription pills! visit  to learn more on how to participate saturday and every day. 
house intelligence committee rules that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia. as i have been saying all along, it is all a big hoax by the democrats based on payments and lies. there should never have been a special councel appointed. witch hunt!

allegations made by senator jon tester against admiral/doctor ron jackson are proving false. the secret service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful jackson family. tester should resign. the.....
....great people of montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. admiral jackson is the kind of man that those in montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. not fair, tester!
“clapper lied about (fraudulent) dossier leaks to cnn” foxandfriends foxnews  he is a lying machine who now works for fake news cnn.
just had a long and very good talk with president moon of south korea. things are going very well, time and location of meeting with north korea is being set. also spoke to prime minister abe of japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.
look forward to being in the great state of michigan tonight. major business expansion and jobs pouring into your state. auto companies expanding at record pace. big crowd tonight, will be live on t.v.
secret service has just informed me that senator jon tester’s statements on admiral jackson are not true. there were no such findings. a horrible thing that we in d.c. must live with, just like phony russian collusion. tester should lose race in montana. very dishonest and sick!
join me live in washington, michigan at 7:00pme on foxnews! maga
great evening last night in washington, michigan. the enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. to the many thousands of people who couldn’t get in, i cherish you....and will be back!
while washington, michigan, was a big success, washington, d.c., just didn’t work. everyone is talking about the fact that the white house correspondents dinner was a very big, boring bust...the so-called comedian really “bombed.” greggutfeld should host next year! petehegseth
just got recent poll - much higher than president o at same time....well, much more has been accomplished!
“trump’s triumphs are driving his critics crazy!” thank you steve hilton nextrevfnc, just want to do what is right for our wonderful u.s.a.
the white house correspondents’ dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. the filthy “comedian” totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the seth meyers weak performance). put dinner to rest, or start over!
headline: “kim prepared to cede nuclear weapons if u.s. pledges not to invade” - from the failing new york times. also, will shut down nuclear test site in may.
the white house correspondents’ dinner is dead as we know it. this was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great country and all that it stands for. fake news is alive and well and beautifully represented on saturday night!
numerous countries are being considered for the meeting, but would peace house/freedom house, on the border of north &amp; south korea, be a more representative, important and lasting site than a third party country? just asking!
i recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of congressional term limits. i gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. draintheswamp
the migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak &amp; ineffective u.s. immigration laws are. yet democrats like jon tester continue to support the open borders agenda – tester even voted to protect sanctuary cities. we need lawmakers who will put america first.
during small business week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!
the fake news is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist). they are totally unhinged, and the great success of this administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying. truly bad people!
the white house is running very smoothly despite phony witch hunts etc. there is great energy and unending stamina, both necessary to get things done. we are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! fake news is going “bonkers!”
so disgraceful that the questions concerning the russian witch hunt were “leaked” to the media. no questions on collusion. oh, i see...you have a made up, phony crime, collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. nice!
delegation heading to china to begin talks on the massive trade deficit that has been created with our country. very much like north korea, this should have been fixed years ago, not now. same with other countries and nafta...but it will all get done. great potential for usa!
it would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! witch hunt!
yesterday, it was my great honor to welcome president mbuhari of the federal republic of nigeria to the whitehouse! 
today i had the great honor of awarding the commander-in-chief’s trophy, for the first time in 21 years, to the armywp_football black knights at the whitehouse. congratulations!
congratulations armywp_football! 
today, it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of southwest airlines flight 1380 at the whitehouse! 
there was no collusion (it is a hoax) and there is no obstruction of justice (that is a setup &amp; trap). what there is is negotiations going on with north korea over nuclear war, negotiations going on with china over trade deficits, negotiations on nafta, and much more. witch hunt!
“the questions are an intrusion into the president’s article 2  powers under the constitution to fire any executive branch employee...what the president was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the president’s unfettered power to fire anyone...” joe digenova, former us attorney
new book - a must read! “the russia hoax - the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump” by the brilliant fox news legal analyst gregg jarrett. a sad chapter for law enforcement. a rigged system!
a rigged system - they don’t want to turn over documents to congress. what are they afraid of? why so much redacting? why such unequal “justice?” at some point i will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the presidency and get involved!
congratulations secpompeo! 
i have been briefed on the u.s. c-130 “hercules” cargo plane from the puerto rico national guard that crashed near savannah hilton head international airport. please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the great men and women of the national guard.
“this isn’t some game. you are screwing with the work of the president of the united states.”  john dowd, march 2018.  with north korea, china, the middle east and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no russian “collusion.”
as everybody is aware, the past administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a north korean labor camp, but to no avail. stay tuned!
ainsley earnhardt, a truly great person, just wrote a wonderful book, “the light within me,” which is doing really well. she is very special and so is her new book...bring it to number one!
our great financial team is in china trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! i look forward to being with president xi in the not too distant future. we will always have a good (great) relationship!
mr. cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or nda. these agreements are.....
...very common among celebrities and people of wealth. in this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in arbitration for damages against ms. clifford (daniels). the agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,......
...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. prior to its violation by ms. clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction.
today, it was my great honor to celebrate the nationaldayofprayer at the whitehouse, in the rose garden! proclamation:  
this spring marks 4yrs since the phoenix va crisis. we won't forget what happened to our great vets. choice is vital, but the program needs work &amp; is running out of $. congress must fix choice program by memorial day so vets can get the care they deserve. i will sign immediately!
nationaldayofprayer 
our southern border is under siege. congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. must build a wall. mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help!
because jobs in the u.s. are doing so well, americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. great!
andy mccarthy will be on  loudobbs tonight. 7:00 p.m. , foxbusiness.
nbc news is wrong again! they cite “sources” which are constantly wrong. problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don’t exist, they are fabricated, fiction! nbc, my former home with the apprentice, is now as bad as fake news cnn. sad!
going to dallas (the great state of texas) today. leaving soon!
just out: 3.9% unemployment. 4% is broken! in the meantime, witch hunt!
all of us here today are united by the same timeless values. we believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no government can ever take it away. we believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement. we have pride in our history... 
democrats and liberals in congress want to disarm law-abiding americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. politicians who put criminal aliens before american citizens should be voted out of office!
we are going to demand congress secure the border in the upcoming cr. illegal immigration must end!
i want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the nra. we will never fail, and we will always protect your second amendment! god bless you, and god bless america! 
great book just out by very successful businessman andypuzder. always known as somebody who knows how to win, “capitalist comeback” will be a big hit!
just returned home to the beautiful white house, from dallas, where the arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the nra. it was so wonderful to be there!
our high level delegation is on the way back from china where they had long meetings with chinese leaders and business representatives. we will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for china in that they have become very spoiled with u.s. trade wins!
thank you cleveland, ohio! 
to the great people of west virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. problem is, don blankenship, currently running for senate, can’t win the general election in your state...no way! remember alabama. vote rep. jenkins or a.g. morrisey!
my highly respected nominee for cia director, gina haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists. think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who democrats want out because she is too tough on terror. win gina!
the russia witch hunt is rapidly losing credibility. house intelligence committee found no collusion, coordination or anything else with russia. so now the probe says ok, what else is there? how about obstruction for a made up, phony crime.there is no o, it’s called fighting back
the 13 angry democrats in charge of the russian witch hunt are starting to find out that there is a court system in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the courts get to see your unrevealed conflicts of interest!
“the great revolt” by salena zito and brad todd does much to tell the story of our great election victory. the forgotten men &amp; women are forgotten no longer!
good luck to ric grenell, our new ambassador to germany. a great and talented guy, he will represent our country well!
lisa page, who may hold the record for the most emails in the shortest period of time (to her lover, peter s), and attorney baker, are out at the fbi as part of the probers getting caught? why is peter s still there? what a total mess. our country has to get back to business!
is this phony witch hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the mid-term elections, which is what the democrats always intended? republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!
the united states does not need john kerry’s possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated iran deal.  he was the one that created this mess in the first place!
national prescription drug takebackday numbers are in! another record broken: nearly 1 million pounds of rx pills disposed! let’s keep fighting this opioid epidemic, america!
i will be announcing my decision on the iran deal tomorrow from the white house at 2:00pm.
gina haspel, my highly respected nominee to lead the cia, is being praised for the fact that she has been, and alway will be, tough on terror! this is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. the cia wants her to lead them into america’s  bright and glorious future!
i will be speaking to my friend, president xi of china, this morning at 8:30. the primary topics will be trade, where good things will happen, and north korea, where relationships and trust are building.
john kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! stay away from negotiations john, you are hurting your country!
statement on the iran nuclear deal: 
the iran deal is defective at its core. if we do nothing, we know what will happen. in just a short time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.... 
the republican party had a great night. tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in november. the economy is sooo strong, and with nancy pelosi wanting to end the big tax cuts and raise taxes, why wouldn’t we win?
the fake news is working overtime. just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy &amp; all things else, 91% of the network news about me is negative (fake). why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? take away credentials?
candace owens of turning point usa is having a big impact on politics in our country. she represents an ever expanding group of very smart “thinkers,” and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our country!
congratulations to mike dewine on his big win in the great state of ohio. he will be a great governor with a heavy focus on healthcare and jobs.  his socialist opponent in november should not do well, a big failure in last job!
i am pleased to inform you that secretary of state mike pompeo is in the air and on his way back from north korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. they seem to be in good health. also, good meeting with kim jong un. date &amp; place set.
secretary pompeo and his “guests” will be landing at andrews air force base at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. i will be there to greet them. very exciting!
the failing new york times criticized secretary of state pompeo for being awol (missing), when in fact he was flying to north korea. fake news, so bad!
looking forward to greeting the hostages (no longer) at 2:00 a.m.
gina haspel did a spectacular job today. there is nobody even close to run the cia!
on behalf of the american people, welcome home! 
senator cryin’ chuck schumer fought hard against the bad iran deal, even going at it with president obama, &amp; then voted against it! now he says i should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that! same with comey. thought he was terrible until i fired him!
five most wanted leaders of isis just captured!
the highly anticipated meeting between kim jong un and myself will take place in singapore on june 12th. we will both try to make it a very special moment for world peace!
thank you indiana! maga 
today, my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the american people. we will have tougher negotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter! 
the american people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them. we will work every day to ensure all americans have access to the quality, affordable medication they need and deserve. we will not rest until the job is done! 
big week next week when the american embassy in israel will be moved to jerusalem. congratulations to all!
why doesn’t the fake news media state that the trump administration’s anti-trust division has been, and is, opposed to the at&amp;t purchase of time warner in a currently ongoing trial. such a disgrace in reporting!
north korea has announced that they will dismantle nuclear test site this month, ahead of the big summit meeting on june 12th. thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!
iran’s military budget is up more than 40% since the obama negotiated nuclear deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. but not anymore!
the senate should get funding done before the august break, or not go home. wall and border security should be included. also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. stay!
happy mother’s day!!! 
president xi of china, and i, are working together to give massive chinese phone company, zte, a way to get back into business, fast. too many jobs in china lost. commerce department has been instructed to get it done!
china and the united states are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. but be cool, it will all work out!
remember how badly iran was behaving with the iran deal in place. they were trying to take over the middle east by whatever means necessary. now, that will not happen!
so sad to see the terror attack in paris. at some point countries will have to open their eyes &amp; see what is really going on. this kind of sickness &amp; hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, &amp; successful country! changes to our thought process on terror must be made.
u.s. embassy opening in jerusalem will be covered live on foxnews &amp; foxbusiness. lead up to 9:00 a.m. (eastern) event has already begun. a great day for israel!
big day for israel. congratulations!
usembassyjerusalem 
zte, the large chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from u.s. companies. this is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with china and my personal relationship with president xi.
the so-called leaks coming out of the white house are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the fake news media in order to make us look as bad as possible. with that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!
heading over to walter reed medical center to see our great first lady, melania. successful procedure, she is in good spirits. thank you to all of the well-wishers!
our great first lady is doing really well. will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. thank you for so much love and support!
trade negotiations are continuing with china. they have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the u.s., for many years. stay tuned!
can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories i get from the fake news media, together with the  $10,000,000 russian witch hunt (there is no collusion), i now have my best poll numbers in a year. much of the media may be corrupt, but the people truly get it!
nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and vote for deb fischer today! 
today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year – the day we pay tribute to the law enforcement heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty. they made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace. we stand with our police (heroes) 100%! 
peaceofficersmemorialday 
thank you to the washington examiner and cortessteve on the great article - on winning! 
congratulations to lou barletta of pennsylvania. he will be a great senator and will represent his people well - like they haven’t been represented in many years. lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help make america great again!
congratulations to deb fischer. the people of nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! maga
the washington post and cnn have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with china. nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china...
...we have not seen china’s demands yet, which should be few in that previous u.s. administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. china has seen our demands. there has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings...
...haven’t even started yet! the u.s. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. china has much to give!
house votes today on choice/mission act. who will stand with our great vets, caregivers, and veterans service organizations? must get choice passed by memorial day!
today, it was my great honor to welcome president mirziyoyev of uzbekistan to the whitehouse! 
lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent, bob casey, has been a do-nothing senator who only shows up at election time. he votes along the nancy pelosi, elizabeth warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare...
...and voted against the massive tax cut bill. he’s also weak on borders and crime. sadly, our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr. lou barletta will win! maga
gina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia. she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately. we need her to keep our great country safe! confirmgina
congratulations america, we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american history...and there is still no collusion and no obstruction. the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money!
wow, word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi “spied on the trump campaign with an imbedded informant.” andrew mccarthy says, “there’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” if so, this is bigger than watergate!

despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted witch hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in u.s. history - by far! sorry to the fake news media and “haters,” but that’s the way it is!
congrats to the house for passing the va mission act yesterday. without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. putting politics over our veterans care is unacceptable – senate must vote yes on this bill by memorial day!
congratulations to our new cia director, gina haspel! 
talking trade with the vice premier of the people’s republic of china, liu he. 
great talk with my friend president mauricio macri of argentina this week. he is doing such a good job for argentina. i support his vision for transforming his country’s economy and unleashing its potential!
tomorrow, the house will vote on a strong farm bill, which includes work requirements. we must support our nation’s great farmers!
it was my great honor to visit with our heroes last night at walter reed medical center. there is nobody like them! 
“apparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign. this has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didn’t commit.”  david asman  loudobbs greggjarrett   really bad stuff!
fake news media had me calling immigrants, or illegal immigrants, “animals.” wrong! they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. i referred to ms 13 gang members as “animals,” a big difference - and so true. fake news got it purposely wrong, as usual!
why isn’t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700,000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia, led by clinton best friend terry m (under fbi investigation that they killed) gave to mccabe’s wife in her run for office? then dropped case on clinton!
reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. it took place very early on, and long before the phony russia hoax became a “hot” fake news story. if true - all time biggest political scandal!
school shooting in texas. early reports not looking good. god bless all!
we grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in texas. to the students, families, teachers and personnel at santa fe high school – we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever... 
america is a nation that believes in the power of redemption. america is a nation that believes in second chances - and america is a nation that believes that the best is always yet to come! prisonreform 
just met with un secretary-general antónio guterres who is working hard to “make the united nations great again.” when the un does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the u.s. has less to do and we save money. nikkihaley is doing a fantastic job! 
california finally deserves a great governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. john cox is the man - he’ll be the best governor you’ve ever had. i fully endorse john cox for governor and look forward to working with him to make california great again!
america is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. we have ended the war on coal, and will continue to work to promote american energy dominance!
happy armedforcesday to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation! 
great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melanie is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melania is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee (also, senate judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. drain the swamp!
things are really getting ridiculous. the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) nytimes has done a long &amp; boring story indicating that the world’s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia &amp; me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!
....at what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 witch hunt, composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years, stop! they have found no collussion with russia, no obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption...
...in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33,000 emails, got $145,000,000 while secretary of state, paid mccabes wife $700,000 (and got off the fbi hook along with terry m) and so much more. republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam.
now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world, they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party. don’t worry about dems fisa abuse, missing emails or fraudulent dossier!
what ever happened to the server, at the center of so much corruption, that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of democrats) fbi? they broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the server?
....and why hasn’t the podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington, d.c.?
the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the world. oh’ great!
i hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration!
i ask senator chuck schumer, why didn’t president obama &amp; the democrats do something about trade with china, including theft of intellectual property etc.? they did nothing! with that being said, chuck &amp; i have long agreed on this issue! fair trade, plus, with china will happen!
china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
on china, barriers and tariffs to come down for first time.
china must continue to be strong &amp; tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made. the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. i want this to happen, and north korea to be very successful, but only after signing!
“john brennan is panicking. he has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the country, he has disgraced the entire intelligence community. he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of american’s faith in the intelligence community and in some people at the....
....top of the fbi. brennan started this entire debacle about president trump. we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) dossier...he knows about the dossier, he denies knowledge of the dossier, he briefs the gang of 8 on the hill about the dossier, which....
...they then used to start an investigation about trump. it is that simple. this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle. this was a political hit job, this was not an intelligence investigation. brennan has disgraced himself, he’s worried about staying out of jail.” dan bongino
the wall street journal asks, “where in the world was barack obama?”  a very good question!
under our potential deal with china, they will purchase from our great american farmers practically as much as our farmers can produce.
.asahutchinson, the great governor of arkansas, is in a primary tomorrow. he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes, border security, and crime prevention. asa loves our military and our veterans. i fully endorse asa for governor!
today, it was my great honor to welcome president moon jae-in of the republic of korea to the whitehouse! 
it was my honor to welcome nascar cup series champion martintruex_jr and his team to the whitehouse yesterday! 
for the first time since roe v. wade, america has a pro-life president, a pro-life vice president, a pro-life house of representatives and 25 pro-life republican state capitals! 
if the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...
...follow the money! the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia, because there was no collusion. he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders, who got duped!
foxandfriends  “new bombshell in the obama spying scandal. did other agencies spy on trump campaign?” even clapper, worlds dumbest former intelligence head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word spy when describing the illegal activities!
look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state. they go after phony collusion with russia, a made up scam, and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! what goes around, comes around!
“it’s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaign” judge andrew napolitano
spygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
everybody is with tomi lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! foxandfriends
“trump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaign” no, james clapper, i am not happy. spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!
our trade deal with china is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.
big legislation will be signed by me shortly. after many years, right to try and big changes to dodd frank.
there will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers. after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!
witch hunt!
thank you sbalist! sbagala 
today on long island, we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of ms-13. i was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the state of the union... 
crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled ms-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and democrats in congress refuse to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as catch-and-release. democrats must abandon their resistance... 
thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in bethpage, new york. keep up the great work! 
great to be in new york for the day. heading back to the whitehouse now, lots of work to be done! 
will be interviewed on foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m. enjoy!
clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign. large dollars were paid to the spy, far beyond normal. starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in u.s. history. spygate - a terrible thing!
not surprisingly, the great men &amp; women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey, mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi. comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi! spygate
sadly, i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jung un. 
sadly, i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jong un. 
it was my great honor to host a roundtable re: ms-13 yesterday in bethpage, new york. democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can support law enforcement and save innocent lives! 
i have decided to terminate the planned summit in singapore on june 12th. while many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, i believe that this is a tremendous setback for north korea and indeed a setback for the world...

i will be making the commencment address today at the united states naval academy in annapolis, maryland. look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth!
the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a spy, as illegal as that may be. but what about an “informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the russian hoax?
can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? and to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, lost!
“everyone knows there was a spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spy...widespread spying involving multiple people.” mollie hemingway, the federalist senior editor  but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story!
democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea. just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals &amp; must be nurtured, or asking to end your big tax cuts &amp; raise your taxes instead. dems have lost touch!
very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea. we will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. only time (and talent) will tell!
today, it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 commencement address at the united states navalacademy in annapolis, maryland. congratulations!  good luck. godspeed. and anchors aweigh! 
on behalf of the american people, congratulations! we love you! 
to the navalacademy class of 2018, i say: we know you are up to the task. we know you will make us proud. we know that glory will be yours. because you are winners, you are warriors, you are fighters, you are champions, and you will lead us to victory! god bless the u.s.a.! 
chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job. the killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!
funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states. lost almost $800 billion/year under “o”
senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks. i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase u.s. parts and pay a $1.3 billion fine. dems do nothing....
...but complain and obstruct. they made only bad deals (iran) and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world!
we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in singapore on the same date, june 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.
good news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela. should be landing in d.c. this evening and be in the white house, with his family, at about 7:00 p.m. the great people of utah will be very happy!
put pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the border into the u.s. catch and release, lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall! democrats are protecting ms-13 thugs.
looking forward to seeing joshua holt this evening in the white house. the great people of utah are celebrating!
thanks to very brave teacher &amp; hero jason seaman of noblesville, indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!
unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe, there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to  how to deal with north korea...and if there was, it wouldn’t matter. the nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!
the failing nytimes quotes “a senior white house official,” who doesn’t exist, as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on june 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.” wrong again! use real people, not phony sources.
with spies, or “informants” as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or “justice” contact me to tell me of the  phony russia problem?
this whole russia probe is rigged. just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven’t been lost in decades. 13 angry democrats, and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years. spygate &amp; conflicts of interest!
when will the 13 angry democrats (&amp; those who worked for president o), reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest? it’s been a long time now! will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems, justice, fbi &amp; russia?
welcome home josh! 
who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt? they journeyed down to washington, d.c., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...they went back home in tatters!
fantastic to have 400,000 great men &amp; women of rolling thunder in d.c. showing their patriotism. they love our country, they love our flag, they stand for our national anthem! thanks to executive director artie muller.
why didn’t the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton, many crimes, much collusion with russia? why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc?  rigged investigation!
our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself. i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day. kim jong un agrees with me on this. it will happen!
why didn’t president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election? because he thought crooked hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! he was in charge, not me, and did nothing.
memorialday 
happy memorial day! those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever (&amp; women in 18years), rebuilding our military and so much more. nice!

“we now find out that the obama administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation. that raises legitimate questions. i just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.” jonathan turley on foxnews
thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance. we are gathered here on the sacred soil of arlingtonnatl cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of america's greatest heroes, the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom. memorialday 
the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields, in cemeteries, battlefields, and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life. they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies, from privilege and from poverty... 
our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny. they saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served. they cared for their families more than anything in the world, they loved their families. they inspired their communities... 
a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts (no chance). this is too good to be true for republicans...remember, the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime, the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang members...not good!
california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others. on june 5th., vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox, a really good and highly competent man. he’ll make california great again!
democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obama’s term showing children from the border in steel cages. they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of country...bipartisan bill!
we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea. meetings are currently taking place concerning summit, and more. kim young chol, the vice chairman of north korea, heading now to new york. solid response to my letter, thank you!
“this investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. it wasn’t just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the trump campaign...people call that spying...this is unprecedented and  scandalous.” mollie hemingway
the 13 angry democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for obama) working on the rigged russia witch hunt, will be meddling with the mid-term elections, especially now that republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in polls. there was no collusion, except by the democrats!
why aren’t the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton. it’s a rigged witch hunt, that’s why! ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
sorry, i’ve got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear, bad trade deals, va choice, the economy, rebuilding the military, and so much more, and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etc.
the fake mainstream media has, from the time i announced i was running for president, run the most highly sophisticated &amp; dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics. no matter how well we do, they find fault. but the forgotten men &amp; women won, i’m president!
rep.trey gowdy, “i don’t think so, i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. if i were the president and i picked someone to be the country’s....
....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ‘oh by the way i’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, i would be frustrated too...and that’s how i read that - senator sessions, why didn’t you tell me before i picked you.....
....there are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!” and i wish i did!
the failing and corrupt nytimes estimated the crowd last night at “1000 people,” when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’. this is the way they demean and disparage. they are very dishonest people who don’t “get” me, and never did!
bob iger of abc called valerie jarrett to let her know that “abc does not tolerate comments like those” made by roseanne barr. gee, he never called president donald j. trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc. maybe i just didn’t get the call?
today i am proud to keep another promise to the american people as i sign the righttotry legislation into law. 
with the righttotry law i signed today, patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions. these are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise... 
moments ago, it was my great honor to sign righttotry into law!  
great meeting with kimkardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. 
there is no one better to represent the people of n.y. and staten island (a place i know very well) than repdandonovan, who is strong on borders &amp; crime, loves our military &amp; our vets, voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again. dan has my full endorsement!
very importantly, repdandonovan will win for the republicans in november...and his opponent will not. remember alabama. we can’t take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat!
the soon to be released book, “the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump,” written by gregg jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit. the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see! out in 5 weeks.
“the recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united states.” joe digenova, former u.s. attorney.
rush limbaugh  “if the fbi was so concerned, and if they weren’t targeting trump, they should have told trump. if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? why not tell trump? because they were pushing this scam.”
iger, where is my call of apology? you and abc have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. how is brian ross doing? he tanked the market with an abc lie, yet no apology. double standard!
the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, spies (informants), into my campaign! surveillance much?
not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia! the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!
very good meetings with north korea.
will be giving a full pardon to dinesh d’souza today. he was treated very unfairly by our government!
fair trade!
a.p. has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. no collusion, except by the democrats!
why aren’t they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? a total double standard but that’s o.k., we are winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!
looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning.
canada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. highly restrictive on trade! they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! they report a really high surplus on trade with us. do timber &amp; lumber in u.s.?
today, it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the united states coast guard! 
“we ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are.”  neil irwin of the nytimes.
“john brennan, no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. he’s a liar about being a liar.”
“john brennan, no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. not only is he a liar, he’s a liar about being a liar.”  dan bongino on foxandfriends
....“$17 million spent, it’s a scam investigation. americans are being worked. we now know there was russian collusion, with russians and the democrats. the mueller team is stacked with anti-trumpers, who actually represented clinton people (&amp; gave $’s to crooked h).” dan bongino
now this is a record that will never be broken! 

very surprised that china would be doing this? 
real foxnews is doing great, fake news cnn is dead! 
there was no collusion with russia (except by the democrats). when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? so bad for our country. is the special councel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media? should be looking at dems corruption instead?

the united states must, at long last, be treated fairly on trade. if we charge a country zero to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated. that is not free or fair trade, it is stupid trade!
why is it that the wall street journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the u.s. by other countries, or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into u.s. coffers?
when you’re almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade, you can’t lose a trade war! the u.s. has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade, time to get smart!
jesse watters “the only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white house.”  so true!
as only one of two people left who could become president, why wouldn’t the fbi or department of “justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? should have told me!
....paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented ronald reagan, bob dole &amp; many others over the years), but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn’t have been hired!
mark penn  “why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff? why is there an independent councel? to go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...constitution was set up to prevent this...stormtrooper tactics almost.” a disgrace!
mark penn  “why are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff? why is there an independent counsel? to go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...constitution was set up to prevent this...stormtrooper tactics almost.” a disgrace!
this is my 500th. day in office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any president in his first 500 days. massive tax &amp; regulation cuts, military &amp; vets, lower crime &amp; illegal immigration, stronger borders, judgeships, best economy &amp; jobs ever, and much more...
....we had repeal &amp; replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway. individual mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month. drug prices coming down &amp; right to try!
“this is the best time ever to look for a job.” james freeman of wsj.
as has been stated by numerous legal scholars, i have the absolute right to pardon myself, but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong? in the meantime, the never ending witch hunt, led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats (&amp; others) continues into the mid-terms!
china already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans. canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products. not acceptable!
the u.s. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win!
the appointment of the special councel is totally unconstitutional! despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrong!
farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. mexico, canada, china and others have treated them unfairly. by the time i finish trade talks, that will change. big trade barriers against u.s. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken. massive trade deficits no longer!
the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional! despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrong!
500days of american greatness:  
the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt.
in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job!
big supreme court ruling for baker just out!
the philadelphia eagles football team was invited to the white house. unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. staying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. sorry!
what is taking so long with the inspector general’s report on crooked hillary and slippery james comey. numerous delays. hope report is not being changed and made weaker! there are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. transparency!
the u.s. has an increased economic value of more than 7 trillion dollars since the election. may be the best economy in the history of our country. record jobs numbers. nice!
we will proudly be playing the national anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our country today at 3 p.m., the white house, with the united states marine band and the united states army chorus. honoring america! nfl, no escaping to locker rooms!
we have had many championship teams recently at the white house including the chicago cubs, houston astros, pittsburgh penguins, new england patriots, alabama and clemson national champions, and many others. national anthem &amp; more great music today at 3:00 p.m.
the russian witch hunt hoax continues, all because jeff sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself...i would have quickly picked someone else. so much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion!
meeting in singapore with north korea will hopefully be the start of something big...we will soon see!
....nascar and champion martintruex_jr were recently at the white house. it was a great day for a great sport!
separating families at the border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the democrats. border security laws should be changed but the dems can’t get their act together! started the wall.
in high tax, high crime california, be sure to get out and vote for republican john cox for governor. he will make a big difference!
get the vote out in california today for rep. kevin mccarthy and all of the great gop candidates for congress. keep our country out of the hands of high tax, high crime nancy pelosi.
vote for congressman devin nunes, a true american patriot the likes of which we rarely see in our modern day world....he truly loves our country and deserves everyone’s support!
senator rogerwicker of mississippi has done everything necessary to make america great again! get out and vote for roger, he has my total support!
terrific new book out by the wonderful harris faulkner, “9 rules of engagement.” harris shares lessons from a military family. enjoy!
the historic rescissions package we’ve proposed would cut $15,000,000,000 in wasteful spending! we are getting our government back on track.
imagine how much wasteful spending we’d save if we didn’t have chuck and nancy standing in our way! for years, democrats in congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end? no more.

wow, strzok-page, the incompetent &amp; corrupt fbi lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign dating way back to december, 2015. spygate is in full force! is the mainstream media interested yet? big stuff!
great interview by loudobbs with chris farrell of judicial watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign. spygate at the highest level. who would believe?
chris farrell, judicial watch. “they were running an operation to undermine a candidate for president of the u.s. these are all violations of law. this is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. there’s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...
...this is a level of criminality beyond the pale. this is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it’s like nothing else we’ve seen in our history. this makes the nixon watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
....the greatest witch hunt in political history!
mitch mcconnell announced he will cancel the senate’s august recess. great, maybe the democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of high crime and high taxes. we need border security!
great night for republicans! congratulations to john cox on a really big number in california. he can win. even fake news cnn said the trump impact was really big, much bigger than they ever thought possible. so much for the big blue wave, it may be a big red wave. working hard!
gold star father, ceejay metcalf, whose great son michael was just honored at the white house, was fantastic this morning on foxandfriends. he is a special man!
the fake news media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great first lady, melania. during her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the w.h. (and me) for n.y. or virginia, to abuse. all fake, she is doing really well!
...four reporters spotted melania in the white house last week walking merrily along to a meeting. they never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. fake news is really bad!
many more republican voters showed up yesterday than the fake news thought possible. the political pundits just don’t get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! remember, dems are high tax, high crime, easy to beat!
congratulations to dana rohrabacher on his big california win. we are proud of you dana!
today we mark another milestone: the 74th anniversary of dday, the allied invasion of normandy. on june 6, 1944, more than 70,000 brave young americans charged out of landing craft, jumped out of airplanes, and stormed into hell... 
we must always protect those who protect us. today, it was my great honor to sign the vamissionact and to make veterans choice the permanent law of the land!  
thank you to everyone at fema hq for today’s briefing on preparations for the upcoming hurricane season. disaster response and recovery is best achieved when it’s federally supported, state managed, and locally executed – this is the successful model we will continue to build. 
isn’t it ironic? getting ready to go to the g-7 in canada to fight for our country on trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to singapore to meet with north korea &amp; the nuclear problem...but back home we still have the 13 angry democrats pushing the witch hunt!
good luck to alice johnson. have a wonderful life!
alan dershowitz, harvard law professor: “it all proves that we never needed a special councel....all of this could have been done by the justice dept. don’t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone’s back. not the way justice should operate.” so true!

when and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 angry democrats (plus) working on the witch hunt hoax. there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election. where is the server?
how could jeff flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn’t have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again? let’s face it, he’s a flake!
looking forward to seeing my friend prime minister abeshinzo of japan at noon. will be discussing north korea and trade.
our justice department must not let awan &amp; debbie wasserman schultz off the hook. the democrat i.t. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. they want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their server. where is server? really bad!
when will people start saying, “thank you, mr. president, for firing james comey?”
the obama administration is now accused of trying to give iran secret access to the financial system of the united states. this is totally illegal. perhaps we could get the 13 angry democrats to divert some of their energy to this “matter” (as comey would call it). investigate!
making america great again!

it’s my great honor to welcome prime minister abeshinzo back to the whitehouse! 
today, i am greatly honored to welcome my good friend, pm abe of japan to the whitehouse. over the past 16 months the prime minister and i have worked closely together to address common challenges, of which there are many... 
pm abe and i are also working to improve the trading relationship between the u.s. and japan, something we have to do. the u.s. seeks a bilateral deal with japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. we’re working hard to reduce our trade imbalance... 
great day of meetings with prime minister abeshinzo of japan! 
please tell prime minister trudeau and president macron that they are charging the u.s. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. the eu trade surplus with the u.s. is $151 billion, and canada keeps our farmers and others out. look forward to seeing them tomorrow.
prime minister trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the u.s. and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our farmers, killing our agriculture!
why isn’t the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers against the u.s. totally unfair to our farmers, workers &amp; companies. take down your tariffs &amp; barriers or we will more than match you!
obama, schumer and pelosi did nothing about north korea, and now weak on crime, high tax schumer is telling me what to do at the summit the dems could never set up. schumer failed with north korea and iran, we don’t need his advice!
canada charges the u.s. a 270%  tariff on dairy products! they didn’t tell you that, did they? not fair to our farmers!
looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the g-7 countries. if it doesn’t happen, we come out even better!
congratulations to the washington capitals on their great play and winning the stanley cup championship. alex ovechkin, the team captain, was spectacular - a true superstar! d.c. is popping, in many ways. what a time!
i am heading for canada and the g-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the united states. from there i go to singapore and talks with north korea on denuclearization. won’t be talking about the russian witch hunt hoax for a while!
my thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in somolia. they are truly all heroes.
my thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in somalia. they are truly all heroes.
.g7 press briefing in charlevoix, canada, prior to departing for singapore! 
henry mcmaster loves the people of south carolina and was with me from the beginning. he is strong on crime and borders, great for our military and our vets. he is doing a fantastic job as your governor, and has my full endorsement, a special guy. vote on tuesday!
just met the new prime minister of italy, giuseppeconteit, a really great guy. he will be honored in washington, at the whitehouse, shortly. he will do a great job - the people of italy got it right!
just left the g7 summit in beautiful canada. great meetings and relationships with the six country leaders especially since they know i cannot allow them to apply large tariffs and strong barriers to...
...u.s.a. trade. they fully understand where i am coming from. after many decades, fair and reciprocal trade will happen!
the united states will not allow other countries to impose massive tariffs and trade barriers on its farmers, workers and companies. while sending their product into our country tax free. we have put up with trade abuse for many decades — and that is long enough.
i am on my way to singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for north korea and the world. it will certainly be an exciting day and i know that kim jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before...
…create peace and great prosperity for his land. i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!
based on justin’s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our u.s. farmers, workers and companies, i have instructed our u.s. reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the u.s. market!
pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our g7 meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that, “us tariffs were kind of insulting” and he “will not be pushed around.” very dishonest &amp; weak. our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!
fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal. according to a canada release, they make almost 100 billion dollars in trade with u.s. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). minimum is 17b. tax dairy from us at 270%. then justin acts hurt when called out!
why should i, as president of the united states, allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses, as they have for decades, while our farmers, workers &amp; taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? not fair to the people of america! $800 billion trade deficit...
....and add to that the fact that the u.s. pays close to the entire cost of nato-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). the european union had a $151 billion surplus-should pay much more for military!
....germany pays 1% (slowly) of gdp towards nato, while we pay 4% of a much larger gdp. does anybody believe that makes sense? we protect europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on trade. change is coming!
great to be in singapore, excitement in the air!
sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on trade anymore. we must put the american worker first!
thank you prime minister lee hsien loong! 
meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end, that doesn’t matter. we will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen!
stock market up almost 40% since the election, with 7 trillion dollars of u.s. value built throughout the economy. lowest unemployment rate in many decades, with black &amp; hispanic unemployment lowest in history, and female unemployment lowest in 21 years. highest confidence ever!
the fact that i am having a meeting is a major loss for the u.s., say the haters &amp; losers. we have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say! we will be fine!
just won big supreme court decision on voting! great news!
our great larry kudlow, who has been working so hard on trade and the economy, has just suffered a heart attack. he is now in walter reed medical center.

i strongly endorse adam laxalt for governor of nevada. adam is smart, works hard, and knows how to win. he will be a great governor. also, will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime!
mark sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to maga. he is mia and nothing but trouble. he is better off in argentina. i fully endorse katie arrington for congress in sc, a state i love. she is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. vote katie!
heading back home from singapore after a truly amazing visit. great progress was made on the denuclearization of north korea. hostages are back home, will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families, no missiles shot, no research happening, sites closing...
...got along great with kim jong-un who wants to see wonderful things for his country. as i said earlier today: anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace! singaporesummit
robert de niro, a very low iq individual, has received to many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. i watched him last night and truly believe he may be “punch-drunk.” i guess he doesn’t...
...realize the economy is the best it’s ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country. wake up punchy!
here is the video, “a story of opportunity” that i shared with kim jong-un at the singaporesummit ➡️ 
it's time for another maga rally. join me in duluth, minnesota on wednesday, june 20th at 6:30pm! tickets➜ 
there is no limit to what noko can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce &amp; engagement w/ the world. chairman kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security &amp; prosperity for his citizens! 
i want to thank chairman kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. our unprecedented meeting – the first between an american president and a leader of north korea – proves that real change is possible! 
the world has taken a big step back from potential nuclear catastrophe! no more rocket launches, nuclear testing or research! the hostages are back home with their families. thank you to chairman kim, our day together was historic!
a year ago the pundits &amp; talking heads, people that couldn’t do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace - “please meet, don’t go to war.” now that we meet and have a great relationship with kim jong un, the same haters shout out, “you shouldn’t meet, do not meet!”
my political representatives didn’t want me to get involved in the mark sanford primary thinking that sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left i felt that katie was such a good candidate, and sanford was so bad, i had to give it a shot. congrats to katie arrington!
robert de niro, a very low iq individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. i watched him last night and truly believe he may be “punch-drunk.” i guess he doesn’t...
...realize the economy is the best it’s ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country. wake up punchy!
congratulations to corey stewart for his great victory for senator from virginia. now he runs against a total stiff, tim kaine, who is weak on crime and borders, and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. don’t underestimate corey, a major chance of winning!
just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day i took office. there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea. meeting with kim jong un was an interesting and very positive experience. north korea has great potential for the future!
before taking office people were assuming that we were going to war with north korea. president obama said that north korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. no longer - sleep well tonight!
we save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!
the u.s., together with mexico and canada, just got the world cup. congratulations - a great deal of hard work!
oil prices are too high, opec is at it again. not good!
so funny to watch the fake news, especially nbc and cnn. they are fighting hard to downplay the deal with north korea. 500 days ago they would have “begged” for this deal-looked like war would break out. our country’s biggest enemy is the fake news so easily promulgated by fools!
senator claire mccaskill of the great state of missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her rv tour of the state. rv’s are not for her. people are really upset, so phony! josh hawley should win big, and has my full endorsement.
congratulations to danny tarkanian on his big gop primary win in nevada. danny worked hard an got a great result. looking good in november!
congratulations to kevincramer on his huge win in north dakota. we need kevin in the senate, and i strongly endorse him. heidi voted no on our tax cuts, and always will vote no when we need her. kevin is strong on crime &amp; borders, big on cutting taxes!
the republican party is starting to show very big numbers. people are starting to see what is being done. results are speaking loudly. north korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!
now that i am back from singapore, where we had a great result with respect to north korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt, always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crime.
so, the democrats make up a phony crime, collusion with the russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (comey) classified information so that a special councel will be appointed, and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news!
the sleazy new york democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) a.g. eric schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000. i won’t settle this case!...
....schneiderman, who ran the clinton campaign in new york, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years. now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle.
happy 243rd birthday to the usarmy! thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, and dedication to the u.s.a. we love you! 
happy flagday 
fbi agent peter strzok, who headed the clinton &amp; russia investigations, texted to his lover lisa page, in the ig report, that “we’ll stop” candidate trump from becoming president. doesn’t get any lower than that!
the ig report is a total disaster for comey, his minions and sadly, the fbi. comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the fbi. i did a great service to the people in firing him. good instincts. christopher wray will bring it proudly back!
thank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the u.s.a., mexico and canada. i worked hard on this, along with a great team of talented people. we never fail, and it will be a great world cup! a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advice.
u.s.a. jobs numbers are the best in 44 years. if my opponent (the democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy, and jobs, would have been a disaster!
wow, the highest rated (by far) morning show, foxandfriends, is on the front lawn of the white house. maybe i’ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?
“why in the world didn’t barack obama fire this guy (comey)?” asks mark levin!
“donald trump was 100% right to fire james comey.” mark levin
the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall, end catch &amp; release, visa lottery and chain, and go to merit based immigration. go for it! win!
wow, what a tough sentence for paul manafort, who has represented ronald reagan, bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns. didn’t know manafort was the head of the mob. what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others? very unfair!
i’ve had to beat 17 very talented people including the bush dynasty, then i had to beat the clinton dynasty, and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig report...and never forget the fake news media. it never ends!
i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany, but the fake news media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask for! 
the fake news media said that i did not get along with other leaders at the g7summit in canada. they are once again, wrong! 
great discussions with european union commission president jean-claude juncker and eu council president donald tusk at the g7summit in canada last week. 
democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation, for a change! this is why we need more republicans elected in november. democrats are good at only three things, high taxes, high crime and obstruction. sad!
my supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. as we get stronger, so does our country. best numbers ever!
the ig report totally distroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, peter strzok and lisa page, who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people. it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history!
the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, peter strzok and lisa page, who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people. it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history!
chuck schumer said “the summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat.” thank you chuck, but are you sure you got that right? no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. hostages already back, hero remains coming home &amp; much more!
please clear up the fake news! 
daniel henninger of the wall street journal: “this ig report makes it clear, as did rod rosenstein’s memo, that trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing jim comey. so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.”  witch hunt!
funny how the fake news, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i “met.” that’s because that’s all they have to disparage! we got so much for peace in the world, &amp; more is being added in finals. even got our hostages/remains!
holding back the “war games” during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. also, quite provocative. can start up immediately if talks break down, which i hope will not happen!
the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia. they are so happy! over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions &amp; millions of lives!
our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been. companies doing really well, and moving back to america, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.
washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isn’t paying them enough. i think a really long strike would be a great idea. employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time! is wapo a registered lobbyist?
witch hunt! there was no russian collusion. oh, i see, there was no russian collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion. the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax. too bad they didn’t look at crooked hillary like this. double standard!
why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media. they are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people fake news, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn’t matter to them!
why was the fbi’s sick loser, peter strzok, working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry &amp; conflicted democrats, when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer lisa page, that “we’ll stop” trump from becoming president? witch hunt!
the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security &amp; safety. don’t wait until after the election because you are going to lose!
“the highest level of bias i’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” trey gowdy on the fbi’s own, peter strzok. also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller. a really sick deal, isn’t it?
why don’t the democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including ms-13, coming into our country illegally?
the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition. crime in germany is way up. big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
we don’t want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us!
children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border. it is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. not going to happen in the u.s.
change the laws!
it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime. tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration. change the laws!
if president obama (who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have, the fake news would have named him a national hero!
comey gave strozk his marching orders. mueller is comey’s best friend. witch hunt!
i can’t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!” inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. a rigged witch hunt!p
crime in germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. others countries are even worse. be smart america!
if you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country!
democrats are the problem. they don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our country, like ms-13. they can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!
we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally. of the 12,000 children, 10,000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions.
changethelaws   now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security.
join me tomorrow in duluth, minnesota for a maga rally! tickets:  
thank you nfib! nfib75 
i want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the southern border...it has been going on for many, many decades... 
homeland security secnielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country, while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete &amp; nasty laws, which force family separation. we want “heart” and security in america!
earlier today, flotus melania and i were honored to welcome king felipe vi and queen letizia of spain to the whitehouse! 
thank you housegop! 
the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration. our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the dems will do anything not to change them &amp; to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!
it’s the democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. they want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. republicans want security. but i am working on something - it never ends!
“fbi texts have revealed anti-trump bias.” foxnews  big news, but the fake news doesn’t want to cover. total corruption - the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam! at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!
more records! maga 

had a great meeting with the house gop last night at the capitol. they applauded and laughed loudly when i mentioned my experience with mark sanford. i have never been a fan of his!
look what fake abc news put out. i guess they had it prepared from the 13 angry democrats leading the witch hunt! stopthebias 
don’t worry, the republicans, and your president, will fix it! 
just landed in duluth, minnesota. two events planned - looking forward to them and being with petestauber and his wonderful family!
so sorry, people wanting to get into the already packed arena - i love you all! 
thank you duluth, minnesota. together, we are making america great again! 
just returning from the great state of minnesota where we had an incredible rally with 9,000 people, and at least 10,000 who could not get in - i will return! congratulations to petestauber who is loved and respected in minnesota!
all-time record optimism! 
we shouldn’t be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the wall, hire border agents and ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.
the border has been a big mess and problem for many years. at some point schumer and pelosi, who are weak on crime and border security, will be forced to do a real deal, so easy, that solves this long time problem. schumer used to want border security - now he’ll take crime!
i will be going the columbia, south carolina, on monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters, a man who truly loves the people of south carolina, governor henry mcmaster. henry worked so hard &amp; was so loyal to me that i look forward to reciprocating!
henry mcmaster has done a great job as governor of south carolina. the state is booming, with jobs and new industry setting records. he is tough on crime and strong on borders, health care, the mititary and our great vets. henry has my full and complete endorsement! maga
last night in minnesota was incredible. what a crowd!
what is the purpose of the house doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by democrats in the senate, and the dems are only looking to obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the mid-terms). republicans must get rid of the stupid filibuster rule-it is killing you!
henry mcmaster has done a great job as governor of south carolina. the state is booming, with jobs and new industry setting records. he is tough on crime and strong on borders, healthcare, the military and our great vets. henry has my full and complete endrosement! maga
democrats want open borders, where anyone can come into our country, and stay. this is nancy pelosi’s dream. it won’t happen!
my administration is acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the southern border. loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border democrats...and that's what they are - they're extremist open border democrats.... 
"the real big story that affects everybody in america is the success of potus's tax cut package and what it's done for our economy...” varneyco 
i was thrilled to be back in minnesota for a roundtable with hardworking american patriots. thank you! 
farm bill just passed in the house. so happy to see work requirements included. big win for the farmers!
big supreme court win on internet sales tax - about time! big victory for fairness and for our country. great victory for consumers and retailers.
“i really don’t care, do u?” written on the back of melania’s jacket, refers to the fake news media. melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!
we have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of – and if we show any weakness, millions of people will journey into our country.
you cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including “heart,” without getting dem votes. problem is, they don’t care about security and r’s do. zero dems voted to support the goodlatte bill. they won’t vote for anything!
our great judge jeanine pirro is out with a new book, “liars, leakers and liberals, the case against the anti-trump conspiracy,” which is fantastic. go get it!
even if we get 100% republican votes in the senate, we need 10 democrat votes to get a much needed immigration bill - &amp; the dems are obstructionists who won’t give votes for political reasons &amp; because they don’t care about crime coming from border! so we need to elect more r’s!
elect more republicans in  november and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive immigration bills anywhere in the world. right now we have the dumbest and the worst. dems are doing nothing but obstructing. remember their motto, resist! ours is produce!
republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in november. dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. we can pass great legislation after the red wave!
governor henry mcmaster is a truly fine man who loves the people of south carolina. he was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a big south carolina victory. i will see you all in s.c on monday and vice president pence will be there for henry on saturday!
congresswoman martha roby of alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our make america great again agenda. she is in a republican primary run-off against a recent nancy pelosi voting democrat. i fully endorse martha for alabama 2nd congressional district!
congressman ron desantis, a top student at yale and harvard law school, is running for governor of the great state of florida. ron is strong on borders, tough on crime &amp; big on cutting taxes - loves our military &amp; our vets. he will be a great governor &amp; has my full endorsement!
80% of mexico’s exports come to the united states. they totally rely on us, which is fine with me. they do have, though, very strong immigration laws. the u.s. has pathetically weak and ineffective immigration laws that the democrats refuse to help us fix. will speak to mexico!
we must maintain a strong southern border. we cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!
hope opec will increase output substantially. need to keep prices down!
based on the tariffs and trade barriers long placed on the u.s. and it great companies and workers by the european union, if these tariffs and barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% tariff on all of their cars coming into the u.s. build them here!
we are gathered today to hear directly from the american victims of illegal immigration. these are the american citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens. these are the families the media ignores...
our first duty, and our highest loyalty, is to the citizens of the united states. we will not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe, and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all. 
based on the tariffs and trade barriers long placed on the u.s. &amp; its great companies and workers by the european union, if these tariffs and barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% tariff on all of their cars coming into the u.s. build them here!
steel is coming back fast! u.s. steel is adding great capacity also. so are others. 
.foxnews  poll numbers plummet on the democrat inspired and paid for russian witch hunt. with all of the bias, lying and hate by the investigators, people want the investigators investigated. much more will come out. a total scam and excuse for the dems losing the election!

my thoughts and prayers are with representative katie arrington of south carolina, including all of those involved in last nights car accident, and their families. 
heading to nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. country’s economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. tremendous potential, and trade deals are coming along well.
it’s very sad that nancy pelosi and her sidekick, cryin’ chuck schumer, want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. the united states cannot stand for this. we wants safety and security at our borders!
happy birthday to supreme court justice clarence thomas, a friend and great man! 
thank you nvgop! maga 
america is open for business! 
major wall street journal opinion piece today talking about the russian witch hunt and the disgrace that it is. so many people hurt, so bad for our country - a total sham! 
democrats, fix the laws. don’t resist. we are doing a far better job than bush and obama, but we need strength and security at the border! cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our country. strong borders, no crime!
we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country. when somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no judges or court cases, bring them back from where they came. our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order. most children come without parents...
....our immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to make america great again!
the united states is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial trade barriers and tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those barriers &amp; tariffs or be met with more than reciprocity by the u.s.a. trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!
.jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous “hair show” with me (where he seriously messed up my hair), &amp; that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have “humanized” me-he is taking heat. he called &amp; said “monster ratings.” be a man jimmy!
.clayhiggins18 has been a great help to me on cutting taxes, creating great new healthcare programs at low cost, fighting for border security, our military and are vets. he is tough on crime and has my full endorsement. the great state of louisiana, we want clay!
house republicans could easily pass a bill on strong border security but remember, it still has to pass in the senate, and for that we need 10 democrat votes, and all they do is resist. they want open borders and don’t care about crime! need more republicans to win in november!
.repclayhiggins has been a great help to me on cutting taxes, creating great new healthcare programs at low cost, fighting for border security, our military and are vets. he is tough on crime and has my full endorsement. the great state of louisiana, we want clay!
former attorney general michael mukasey said that president trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on trump tower. actually, far greater than would ever have been believed!
the red hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like sarah huckabee sanders. i always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!
i have tried to stay uninvolved with the department of justice and fbi (although i do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive witch hunt currently going on. but you do have to ask why the doj &amp; fbi aren’t giving over requested documents?
such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the obama administration and ours. actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under obama. fake news is working overtime!
hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the u.s. illegally. children brought back to their country......
....if this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it’s tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost. this is the only real answer - and we must continue to build the wall!
will be heading to one of my favorite places, south carolina, to fight for one of my original “fighters,” governor henry mcmaster. speaking at 7:00 p.m.
congresswoman maxine waters, an extraordinarily low iq person, has become, together with nancy pelosi, the face of the democrat party. she has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the make america great again movement. be careful what you wish for max!
surprised that harley-davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the white flag. i fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the e.u., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 billion. taxes just a harley excuse - be patient!  maga

why is senator mark warner (d-va), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and bob mueller, the leader of the 13 angry democrats on a witch hunt, knows? isn’t this highly illegal. is it being investigated?
the hearing of peter strzok and the other hating frauds at the fbi &amp; doj should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. we should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!
just landed in south carolina - will be at the mcmaster rally shortly! maga
thank you south carolina. now let’s get out tomorrow and vote for henrymcmaster! 
early this year harley-davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in kansas city to thailand. that was long before tariffs were announced. hence, they were just using tariffs/trade war as an excuse. shows how unbalanced &amp; unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....
....we are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. we are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. they must play fair or they will pay tariffs!
....when i had harley-davidson officials over to the white house, i chided them about tariffs in other countries, like india, being too high. companies are now coming back to america. harley must know that they won’t be able to sell back into u.s. without paying a big tax!
....we are finishing our study of tariffs on cars from the e.u. in that they have long taken advantage of the u.s. in the form of trade barriers and tariffs. in the end it will all even out - and it won’t take very long!
it was great being with governor henry mcmaster last night in south carolina. henry is tough on crime and borders, loves our military and our vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. go out and vote for henry today, he will never let you down!
a harley-davidson should never be built in another country-never! their employees and customers are already very angry at them. if they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! the aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!
the face of the democrats is now maxine waters who, together with nancy pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. they should always stay together and lead the democrats, who want open borders and unlimited crime, well into the future....and pick crooked hillary for pres.

tremendous win for congressman dan donovan. you showed great courage in a tough race! new york, and my many friends on staten island, have elected someone they have always been very proud of. congratulations!
wow! big trump hater congressman joe crowley, who many expected was going to take nancy pelosi’s place, just lost his primary election. in other words, he’s out! that is a big one that nobody saw happening. perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his president!
the democrats are in turmoil! open borders and unchecked crime a certain way to lose elections. republicans are for strong borders, no crime! a big night!

congratulations to maxine waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with nancy pelosi, the unhinged face of the democrat party. together, they will make america weak again! but have no fear, america is now stronger than ever before, and i’m not going anywhere!
house republicans should pass the strong but fair immigration bill, known as goodlatte ii, in their afternoon vote today, even though the dems won’t let it pass in the senate. passage will show that we want strong borders &amp; security while the dems want open borders = crime.  win!
supreme court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the union deciding for them. big loss for the coffers of the democrats!
harley-davidson should stay 100% in america, with the people that got you your success. i’ve done so much for you, and then this. other companies are coming back where they belong! we won’t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very happy competitors!

lover fbi agent peter strzok was given poor marks on yesterday’s closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. there was no collusion and the witch hunt, headed by 13 angry democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is rigged!
russia continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling in our election! where is the dnc server, and why didn’t shady james comey and the now disgraced fbi agents take and closely examine it? why isn’t hillary/russia being looked at? so many questions, so much corruption!

peter strzok worked as the leader of the rigged witch hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. but remember, he took his orders from comey and mccabe and they took their orders from you know who. mueller/comey best friends!
when is bob mueller going to list his conflicts of interest? why has it taken so long? will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 report...and what about the 13 angry democrats, will they list their conflicts with crooked h? how many people will be sent to jail and......
....persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion)...and what is going on in the fbi &amp; doj with crooked hillary, the dnc and all of the lies? a disgraceful situation!

the democrats are making a strong push to abolish ice, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that i have ever seen. i have watched ice liberate towns from the grasp of ms-13 &amp; clean out the toughest of situations. they are great!
to the great and brave men and women of ice, do not worry or lose your spirit. you are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. so brave! the radical left dems want you out. next it will be all police. zero chance, it will never happen!
just spoke to king salman of saudi arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil &amp; disfunction in iran and venezuela, i am asking that saudi arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...prices to high! he has agreed!
i will be making my choice for justice of the united states supreme court on the first monday after the july 4th holiday, july 9th!
a friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, sean spicer, has written a great new book, “the briefing: politics, the press and the president.” it is a story told with both heart and knowledge. really good, go get it!
i never pushed the republicans in the house to vote for the immigration bill, either goodlatte 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. i released many prior to the vote knowing we need more republicans to win in nov.
either we need to elect more republicans in november or republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both. cryin’ chuck would do it on day one, but we’ll never give him the chance. some great legislation awaits - be smart!
i will be interviewed by mariabartiromo on sunday on foxnews at 10:00 a. m. enjoy!
when people come into our country illegally, we must immediately escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. republicans want strong borders and no crime. dems want open borders and are weak on crime!
i will be interviewed by mariabartiromo at 10:00 a.m. on foxnews
the liberal left, also known as the democrats, want to get rid of ice, who do a fantastic job, and want open borders. crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! make america great again
a big week, especially with our numerous victories in the supreme court. heading back to the white house now. focus will be on the selection of a new supreme court justice. exciting times for our country. economy may be stronger than it has ever been!
congratulations to andres manuel lopez obrador on becoming the next president of mexico. i look very much forward to working with him. there is much to be done that will benefit both the united states and mexico!
today, it was my great honor to welcome prime minister mark rutte of the netherlands, to the whitehouse! 
many democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their “leadership” wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ice, thereby declaring war on law &amp; order. these people will be voting for republicans in november and, in many cases, joining the republican party!
crazy maxine waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with nancy pelosi, the face of the democrat party. her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the democrats!
i interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday. on monday i will be announcing my decision for justice of the united states supreme court!
the economy is doing perhaps better than ever before, and that’s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair trade deals ever made by any country. in any event, they are coming along very well. most countries agree that they must be changed, but nobody ever asked!
when we have an “infestation” of ms-13 gangs in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ice! they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. dems do not appreciate the great job they do! nov.
how can the democrats, who are weak on the border and weak on crime, do well in november. the people of our country want and demand safety and security, while the democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great law enforcement!
many good conversations with north korea-it is going well! in the meantime, no rocket launches or nuclear testing in 8 months. all of asia is thrilled. only the opposition party, which includes the fake news, is complaining. if not for me, we would now be at war with north korea!
just out that the obama administration granted citizenship, during the terrible iran deal negotiation, to 2,500 iranians - including to government officials. how big (and bad) is that?
now that harley-davidson is moving part of its operation out of the u.s., my administration is working with other motor cycle companies who want to move into the u.s. harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. the u.s. is where the action is!
wow! the nsa has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages. privacy violations? they blame technical irregularities. such a disgrace. the witch hunt continues!
the washington post is constantly quoting “anonymous sources” that do not exist. rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. they are a discgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!
after having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. i capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!
heading to west virginia to be with my friend, wvgovernor jim justice, at his beautiful greenbrier resort. he works hard, does a great job, and raises lots of money for charities!
the washington post is constantly quoting “anonymous sources” that do not exist. rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. they are a disgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!
just arrived in west virginia! 
after having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the fake news constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. i capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!
thank you, wvgovernor jim justice, for that warm introduction. tonight, it was my great honor to attend the “greenbrier classic – salute to service dinner” in west virginia! god bless our veterans. god bless america - and happy independence day to all! 
tonight we gathered to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible: our brave service members, and our wonderful veterans. for 242 years, american independence...
...has endured because of the sweat, blood and sacrifice of the american armed forces – the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world!
tomorrow, families across our nation will gather to celebrate the fourth of july. as we do, we will think of the men &amp; women serving overseas at this very moment, far away from their families, protecting america - &amp; we will thank god for blessing us with these incredible heroes! 
happy fourth of july....our country is doing great!

the opec monopoly must remember that gas prices are up &amp; they are doing little to help. if anything, they are driving prices higher as the united states defends many of their members for very little $’s. this must be a two way street. reduce pricing now!
happy birthday, america! 
congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable immigration laws now. law enforcement at the border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. when people, with or without children, enter our country, they must be told to leave without our........
.....country being forced to endure a long and costly trial. tell the people “out,” and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. hiring thousands of “judges” does not work and is not acceptable - only country in the world that does this!
congress - fix our insane immigration laws now!
i have accepted the resignation of scott pruitt as the administrator of the environmental protection agency. within the agency scott has done an outstanding job, and i will always be thankful to him for this. the senate confirmed deputy at epa, andrew wheeler, will...
...on monday assume duties as the acting administrator of the epa. i have no doubt that andy will continue on with our great and lasting epa agenda. we have made tremendous progress and the future of the epa is very bright!
it was my great honor to join proud, hardworking american patriots in montana tonight. i love you - thank you! maga 
a vote for democrats in november is a vote to let ms-13 run wild in our communities, to let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking americans. democrats want anarchy, amnesty and chaos - republicans want law, order and justice!
every day, the brave men and women of ice are liberating communities from savage gangs like ms-13. we will not stand for these vile democrat smears in law enforcement. we will always stand proudly with the brave heroes of ice and border patrol!
thanks to republican leadership, america is winning again - and america is being respected again all over the world. because we are finally putting america first!
jobs, jobs, jobs! 
just won lawsuit filed by the dnc and a bunch of democrat crazies trying to claim the trump campaign (and others), colluded with russia. they haven’t figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!
twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. will that include the failing new york times and propaganda machine for amazon, the washington post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my opinion, don’t exist - they will both be out of business in 7 years!
big decision will soon be made on our next justice of the supreme court!
public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the “special” councel because the public understands that there was no  collusion with russia (so ridiculous), that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation &amp; that the only collusion was with the dems!
public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the “special” counsel because the public understands that there was no  collusion with russia (so ridiculous), that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation &amp; that the only collusion was with the dems!
the rigged witch hunt, originally headed by fbi lover boy peter s (for one year) &amp; now, 13 angry democrats, should look into the missing dnc server, crooked hillary’s illegally deleted emails, the pakistani fraudster, uranium one, podesta &amp; so much more. it’s a democrat con job!
the u.s. is working very closely with the government of thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. very brave and talented people!

looking forward to announcing my final decision on the united states supreme court justice at 9:00pme tomorrow night at the whitehouse. an exceptional person will be chosen!
they just didn't get it, but they do now! 
the united states is spending far more on nato than any other country. this is not fair, nor is it acceptable. while these countries have been increasing their contributions since i took office, they must do much more. germany is at 1%, the u.s. is at 4%, and nato benefits.......
...europe far more than it does the u.s. by some accounts, the u.s. is paying for 90% of nato, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. on top of this the european union has a trade surplus of $151 million with the u.s., with big trade barriers on u.s. goods. no!
i have long heard that the most important decision a u.s. president can make is the selection of a supreme court justice - will be announced tonight at 9:00 p.m.
i have confidence that kim jong un will honor the contract we signed &amp;, even more importantly, our handshake. we agreed to the denuclearization of north korea. china, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on chinese trade-hope not!
the failing ny times fake news story today about breast feeding must be called out. the u.s. strongly supports breast feeding but we don’t believe women should be denied access to formula. many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.
pfizer &amp; others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. they are merely taking advantage of the poor &amp; others unable to defend themselves, while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in europe &amp; elsewhere. we will respond!
happy 100th birthday to our amazing current and former army warrant officers. thank you for your century of service, as the indispensable guardians of our great usarmy’s technology! centuryofservice 
tonight, it was my honor and privilege to nominate judge brett kavanaugh to the united states supreme court. scotus 
getting ready to leave for europe. first meeting - nato. the u.s. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. not fair to the u.s. taxpayer. on top of that we lose $151 billion on trade with the european union. charge us big tariffs (&amp; barriers)!
nato countries must pay more, the united states must pay less. very unfair!
thank you to all of my great supporters, really big progress being made. other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. economy is roaring. supreme court pick getting great reviews. new poll says trump, at over 90%, is the most popular republican in history of the party. wow!
on behalf of the united states, congratulations to the thai navy seals and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in thailand. such a beautiful moment - all freed, great job!
i am on air force one flying to nato and hear reports that the fbi lovers, peter strzok and lisa page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the rigged witch hunt headed by 13 angry democrats and people that worked for obama for 8 years. total disgrace!
informing the republican senators of my nomination of judge brett kavanaugh. scotus 
many countries in nato, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. will they reimburse the u.s.?
a recent emerson college epoll said that most americans, especially hispanics, feel that they are better off under president trump than they were under president obama.
the european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe (u.s. has a $151 billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through nato, and nicely pay for it. just doesn’t work!
just talked with pfizer ceo and secazar on our drug pricing blueprint. pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so american patients don’t pay more. we applaud pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. great news for the american people!
bilateral breakfast with nato secretary general in brussels, belgium... 
i am in brussels, but always thinking about our farmers. soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. farmers have done poorly for 15 years. other countries’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. i will open...
...things up, better than ever before, but it can’t go too quickly. i am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!
democrats in congress must no longer obstruct - vote to fix our terrible immigration laws now. i am watching what is going on from europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. they are just using children!
what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? the u.s. is paying for europe’s protection, then loses billions on trade. must pay 2% of gdp immediately, not by 2025.

if the democrats want to win supreme court and other court picks, don’t obstruct and resist, but rather do it the good ol’ fashioned way, win elections!
ex-fbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress! wow, but is anybody really surprised!  together with her lover, fbi agent peter strzok, she worked on the rigged witch hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever!
how can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former fbi agent/lover peter strzok? read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clear!
billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn’t nearly enough. u.s. spends too much. europe’s borders are bad! pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable!
as i head out to a very important nato meeting, i see that fbi lover/agent lisa page is dodging a subpoena &amp; is refusing to show up and testify. what can she possibly say about her statements and lies. so much corruption on the other side. where is the attorney general? foxnews
presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia. they pay only a fraction of their cost. the u.s. pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe, and loses big on trade!
....on top of it all, germany just started paying russia, the country they want protection from, billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia. not acceptable! all nato nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!
natosummit2018 press conference in brussels, belgium: 
thank you nato2018! 
“trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment. in june, for instance, the unemployment rate for hispanics and latinos 16 years and older fell to 4.6%, its lowest level ever, from 4.9% in may.” 
a very nice note from chairman kim of north korea. great progress being made! 
great success today at nato! billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. great spirit!
congressman matt gaetz of florida is one of the finest and most talented people in congress. strong on crime, the border, illegal immigration, the 2nd amendment, our great military &amp; vets, matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our massive tax cuts. he has my full endorsement!
joint press conference with prime minister theresa may... 
 
this is now changing - for the first time! 
i have arrived in scotland and will be at trump turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf - my primary form of exercise! the weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible! tomorrow i go to helsinki for a monday meeting with vladimir putin.
the stock market hit 25,000 yesterday. jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. it is all happening!
the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration, not the trump administrations. why didn’t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september, before the election?
....where is the dnc server, and why didn’t the fbi take possession of it? deep state?
the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration, not the trump administration. why didn’t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september, before the election?
so funny! i just checked out fake news cnn, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of jim acosta (actually a nice guy). they didn’t! but they did say i already lost in my meeting with putin. fake news......
....remember, it was little jeff z and his people, who are told exactly what to say, who said i could not win the election in that “there was no way to 270” (over &amp; over again) in the electoral college. i got 306! they were sooooo wrong in their election coverage. still hurting!
our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in japan. we commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones. 
these russian individuals did their work during the obama years. why didn’t obama do something about it?  because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win, that’s why. had nothing to do with the trump administration, but fake news doesn’t want to report the truth, as usual!
there hasn’t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in north korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn’t the fake news talking about these wonderful facts? because it is fake news!
heading to helsinki, finland – looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow. unfortunately, no matter how well i do at the summit, if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia...
...over the years, i would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition! much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the dems...
...know how to do is resist and obstruct! this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country – but at some point, it will heal!
congratulations to france, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 world cup. additionally, congratulations to president putin and russia for putting on a truly great world cup tournament -- one of the best ever!
received many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present &amp; future. we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. nato is now strong &amp; rich!
president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, &amp; did nothing about it. when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok!
our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of u.s. foolishness and stupidity and now, the rigged witch hunt!
it was an honor to join you this morning. thank you! 
joint press conference from helsinki, finland: 
thank you helsinki, finland! 
as i said today and many times before, “i have great confidence in my intelligence people.” however, i also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! helsinki2018
i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. helsinki2018 
a productive dialogue is not only good for the united states and good for russia, but it is good for the world. helsinki2018 
will be interviewed on seanhannity tonight at 9pme and tuckercarlson tomorrow night at 8pme. enjoy!
thank you randpaul, you really get it! “the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed think?”
i had a great meeting with nato. they have paid $33 billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future, only because of me. nato was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for russia). the media only says i was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!
while i had a great meeting with nato, raising vast amounts of money, i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia. sadly, it is not being reported that way - the fake news is going crazy!
thank you randpaul. “the president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed to think?”
the economy of the united states is stronger than ever before!
the meeting between president putin and myself was a great success, except in the fake news media!
the democrats want to abolish ice, which will mean more crime in our country. i want to give ice a big cheer! vote republican in november.
“prosperity is returning. donald trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate, now as the most effective president, the most successful president, in modern american history.” thank you to the great lou dobbs!
so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki. putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. big results will come!
while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. many positive things will come out of that meeting..
....russia has agreed to help with north korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. there is no rush, the sanctions remain! big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process!
congratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress. my endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the “flood gates” opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. enjoy!
“a lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.”  foxandfriends  kilmeade
some people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia. they would rather go to war than see this. it’s called trump derangement syndrome!
3.4 million jobs created since our great election victory - far greater than ever anticipated, and only getting better as new and greatly improved trade deals start coming to fruition!
brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia. the primary is on tuesday. brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment. i give him my full and total endorsement.
thank you to congressman kevin yoder! he secured $5 billion for border security. now we need congress to support. kevin has been strong on crime, the border, the 2nd amendment, and he loves our military and vets. repkevinyoder has my full and total endorsement!
the two biggest opponents of ice in america today are the democratic party and ms-13!
a total disgrace that turkey will not release a respected u.s. pastor, andrew brunson, from prison. he has been held hostage far too long. rt_erdogan should do something to free this wonderful christian husband &amp; father. he has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him!
thank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. likewise to pfizer. we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs.
the democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ice. this should cost them heavily in the midterms. yesterday, the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ice!
the fake news media is going crazy! they make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. but i’ll complain anyway!
the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that i’ll probably have a good relationship with putin. we are doing much better than any other country!
“trump recognized russian meddling many times.” thank you to foxandfriends and foxnews for actually showing the clips. the fake news wants no part of that narrative! too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set.
really big jobs meeting today at the white house! 3 p.m.
i told you so! the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies, google. they truly have taken advantage of the u.s., but not for long!
the summit with russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the fake news media. i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for israel, nuclear........
“trump recognized russian meddling many times.” 
....proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, ukraine, middle east peace, north korea and more. there are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can all be solved!
“trump recognized russian meddling many times” 
will the dems and fake news ever learn? this is classic! 
my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri. such a tragedy, such a great loss. may god be with you all!
china, the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the u.s. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. as usual, not a level playing field...
....the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well. tightening now hurts all that we have done. the u.s. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals. debt coming due &amp; we are raising rates - really?
farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. the price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the election. a big reason is bad (terrible) trade deals with other countries. they put on massive tariffs and barriers. canada charges 275% on dairy. farmers will win!
so important. should have been done years ago! 
i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin. in the old days they would call it diplomacy. if i was loud &amp; vicious, i would have been criticized for being too tough. remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim? hypocrites!
the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again - can’t believe it! isn’t it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? the $40,000,000 commissioner must now make a stand. first time kneeling, out for game. second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!
inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of &amp; perhaps illegal. the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong!
the rigged witch hunt, headed by the 13 angry democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for obama w.h.), seems intent on damaging the republican party’s chances in the november election. this democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 election never ends!
no collusion, no obstruction - but that doesn’t matter because the 13 angry democrats, who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats, want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election. republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!
brian kemp, who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement, is campaigning tonight with mikepencevp. brian is very strong on crime and borders, loves our military, vets and the 2nd amendment. he will be a great governor!
brian kemp, who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement, is campaigning tonight with vp mike_pence. brian is very strong on crime and borders, loves our military, vets and the 2nd amendment. he will be a great governor!
troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on crime &amp; borders. troy is the total opposite, and loves our military, vets &amp; 2nd amendment. early voting just started with election day on august 7th. troy has my full &amp; total endorsement!
watching los angeles possible hostage situation very closely. active barricaded suspect. l.a.p.d. working with federal law enforcement.
congratulations to judicialwatch and tomfitton on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents. as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of “justice” and fbi misled the courts. witch hunt rigged, a scam!
looking more &amp; more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc. ask her how that worked out - she did better with crazy bernie. republicans must get tough now. an illegal scam!
andrew mccarthy - “i said this could never happen. this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. it is so bad it screams out at you.”  on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt!
.petehegseth on foxnews  “source 1 was the (fake) dossier. yes, the dirty dossier, paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump, and looking for information that could discredit candidate 1 trump. carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign...” illegal!
i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. so bad for our country!
happy birthday senatordole! 
so president obama knew about russia before the election. why didn’t he do something about it? why didn’t he tell our campaign? because it is all a big hoax, that’s why, and he thought crooked hillary was going to win!!!
to iranian president rouhani: never, ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence &amp; death. be cautious!
tom fitton on foxandfriends at 6:15 a.m. now! judicial watch.
so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier, that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc, that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt!
“it was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team. this is a clinton campaign document. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump....
....and the doj, fbi and obama gang need to be held to account. source 1 was the major source. avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it. misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team. not about carter page..was all about getting trump.....
.....”carter page wasn’t a spy, wasn’t an agent of the russians - he would have cooperated with the fbi. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump.” tom fitton judicialwatch a disgrace to america. they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now!
when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin, and all that i gave up, remember, i gave up nothing, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the corrupt media!
a rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months. likewise, no nuclear tests. japan is happy, all of asia is happy. but the fake news is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that i am angry because it is not going fast enough. wrong, very happy!
the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the u.s. supreme court two months ago. next up is the u.s. post office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their “delivery boy” for a big percentage of their packages....
....in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for amazon. is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?
robert will do a great job for our vets. we also recently won choice! 
lou barletta was one of my first supporters. he is tough on crime and borders. will be a great senator from pennsylvania. his opponent is weak on crime, ice and borders. we need lou! 
madeinamerica showcase! 
countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate. this should have taken place many years ago but, as the saying goes, better late than never!
tariffs are the greatest! either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with tariffs. it’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! remember, we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed. all will be great!
today is the day to vote for brian kemp. will be great for georgia, full endorsement! 
our country is doing great. best financial numbers on the planet. great to have usa winning again!
heading to missouri to be with many of my great friends. vfw here we come!
make america great again!
i’m very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election. based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the democrats. they definitely don’t want trump!
vfwconvention vfwhq 
i want to thank the vfwhq for your devotion to our fallen heroes, unknown soldiers, prisoners of war, those missing in action, and their families. vfwconvention 
on the heels of the very successful launch of the whitehouse national council for the american worker, congress should reauthorize perkinscte and ensure the american workforce remains stronger than ever! jobs workforce
today, it was my great honor to be in kansas city, missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make freedom possible! thank you vfwhq! vfwconvention 
the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade. i have an idea for them. both the u.s. and the e.u. drop all tariffs, barriers and subsidies! that would finally be called free market and fair trade! hope they do it, we are ready - but they won’t!
so sad and unfair that the fcc wouldn’t approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune. this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people. liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not sinclair. disgraceful!
“the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton &amp; frame donald trump” is a hot seller, already number one! more importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly. congratulations to gregg jarrett!
every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs, i wonder, what can they be thinking? are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  lost $817 billion on trade last year. no weakness!
when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. negotiations are going really well, be cool. the end result will be worth it!
china is targeting our farmers, who they know i love &amp; respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the u.s. they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. we were being nice - until now! china made $517 billion on us last year.
what kind of a lawyer would tape a client? so sad! is this a first, never heard of it before? why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while i was presumably saying positive things? i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? too bad!
congratulations to brian kemp on your very big win in georgia last night. wow, 69-30, those are big numbers. now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you. she is weak on vets, the military and the 2nd amendment. win!
the united states and the european union have a $1 trillion bilateral trade relationship – the largest economic relationship in the world. we want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all american and european citizens... 
this week, my administration is hosting the first-ever irfministerial. the u.s. will continue to promote religiousfreedom around the world. nations that support religious freedom are far more free, prosperous &amp; peaceful. great job, vp, secpompeo, irf_ambassador &amp; statedept!
sergio marchionne, who passed away today, was one of the most brilliant &amp; successful car executives since the days of the legendary henry ford. it was a great honor for me to get to know sergio as potus, he loved the car industry, and fought hard for it. he will be truly missed!
thank you very much, working hard! 
great meeting on trade today with junckereu and representatives of the european union. we have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs, no barriers and no subsidies. work on documents has already started and the process is moving...
...along quickly. european union nations will be open to the united states and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them. there was great warmth and feeling in the room - a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible!
obviously the european union, as represented by junckereu and the united states, as represented by yours truly, love each other! 
thank you georgia! they say that my endorsement last week of brian kemp, in the republican primary for governor against a very worthy opponent, lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! two very good and talented men in a great race, but congratulations to brian!
great to be back on track with the european union. this was a big day for free and fair trade!
european union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. also, they will be buying vast amounts of lng!
twitter “shadow banning” prominent republicans. not good. we will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! many complaints.
heading to dubuque, iowa and then granite city, illinois. looking  forward to being with many great friends!
this is great - on my way, see you soon iagovernor kim reynolds! 
the united states will impose large sanctions on turkey for their long time detainment of pastor andrew brunson, a great christian, family man and wonderful human being. he is suffering greatly. this innocent man of faith should be released immediately!
thank you u_s_steel and granite city, illinois! 
promises kept! 
.alandersh, a brilliant lawyer, who although a liberal democrat who probably didn’t vote for me, has discussed the witch hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way. he has written a new and very important book...
...called “the case against impeaching trump,” which i would encourage all people with trump derangement syndrome to read!
america is open for business and u.s. steel is back! 
the remains of american servicemen will soon be leaving north korea and heading to the united states! after so many years, this will be a great moment for so many families. thank you to kim jong un.
way to go jerry. this is what the league should do! 
arrived back in washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major u.s. steel plant in granite city, illinois, only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted robert mueller and his gang of 13 angry democrats obviously cannot find collusion...
....,the only collusion with russia was with the democrats, so now they are looking at my tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged witch hunt continues! how stupid and unfair to our country....and so the fake news doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions, no,....
.....i did not know of the meeting with my son, don jr. sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (taxi cabs maybe?). he even retained bill and crooked hillary’s lawyer. gee, i wonder if they helped him make the choice!
great gdp numbers just released. will be having a news conference soon!
.johnjamesmi, who is running in the republican primary in the great state of michigan, is spectacular! vote on august 7th. rarely have i seen a candidate with such great potential. west point graduate, successful businessman and a african american leader...
...john is strong on crime and borders, loves our military, our vets and our second amendment. he will be a star. he has my full and total endorsement!
.troy_balderson of ohio is running for congress - so important to the republican party. cast you early vote or vote on august 7th. troy is strong on crime and borders, loves our military, our vets and our second amendment. he has my full and total endorsement!
i am thrilled to announce that in the second quarter of this year, the u.s. economy grew at the amazing rate of 4.1%! 
we have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions! 
the usnavy’s first female admiral, alene duerk once said: “it was a nice distinction to have, and to be recognized as the first, but i wanted to make certain that i used that notoriety to do as much positive as i could.” alene did just that, and america is forever grateful! 
private business investment has surged from 1.8 percent the year before i came into office to 9.4 percent this year -- that means jobs, jobs, jobs! 
congressman david kustoff has been a champion for the trump agenda - i greatly appreciate his support. david is strong on crime and borders, loves our military, vets and second amendment. get out and vote for david on thursday, august 2nd. he has my full and total endorsement!
democrats, who want open borders and care little about crime, are incompetent, but they have the fake news media almost totally on their side!
the only things the democrats do well is “resist,” which is their campaign slogan, and “obstruct.” cryin’ chuck schumer has almost 400 great american people that are waiting “forever” to serve our country! a total disgrace. mitch m should not let them go home until all approved!
join me in tampa, florida next tuesday, july 31st at 7:00pme for a maga rally! tickets:  

tom homan, fmr ice director: “there is nobody that has done more for border security &amp; public safety than president trump. i’ve worked for six presidents, and i respect them all, but nobody has done more than this administration &amp; president trump, that’s just a stone cold fact!”
wow, highest poll numbers in the history of the republican party. that includes honest abe lincoln and ronald reagan. there must be something wrong, please recheck that poll!
do you think the fake news media will ever report on this tweet from michael? 
please understand, there are consequences when people cross our border illegally, whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. congress must act on fixing the dumbest &amp; worst immigration laws anywhere in the world! vote “r”
had a very good and interesting meeting at the white house with a.g. sulzberger, publisher of the new york times. spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media &amp; how that fake news has morphed into phrase, “enemy of the people.” sad!
the biggest and best results coming out of the good gdp report was that the quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by $52 billion and, of course, the historically low unemployment numbers, especially for african americans, hispanics, asians and women.
i would be willing to “shut down” government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security, which includes the wall! must get rid of lottery, catch &amp; release etc. and finally go to system of immigration based on merit! we need great people coming into our country!
when the media - driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it  truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk! very unpatriotic! freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news...
...accurately. 90% of media coverage of my administration is negative, despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving, it’s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low! i will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-trump haters in the...
...dying newspaper industry. no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people! as an example, the failing new york times...
...and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change!
there is no collusion! the robert mueller rigged witch hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an obama white house lawyer) angry democrats, was started by a fraudulent dossier, paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc. therefore, the witch hunt is an illegal scam!
is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty &amp; contentious business relationship, i turned him down to head the fbi (one day before appointment as s.c.) &amp; comey is his close friend..
....also, why is mueller only appointing angry dems, some of whom have worked for crooked hillary, others, including himself, have worked for obama....and why isn’t mueller looking at all of the criminal activity &amp; real russian collusion on the democrats side-podesta, dossier?
we must have border security, get rid of chain, lottery, catch &amp; release sanctuary cities - go to merit based immigration. protect ice and law enforcement and, of course, keep building, but much faster, the wall!
it is my great honor to welcome prime minister giuseppeconteit of italy to the whitehouse! join us at 2:00pme for our joint press conference:  
 
congratulations to general john kelly. today we celebrate his first full year as whitehouse chief of staff! 
.troy_balderson of ohio is running for congress - so important to the republican party. troy is strong on crime and borders, loves our military, our vets and our second amendment. troy will strongly protect...
...your social security and medicare! cast your early vote, or vote on august 7th, election day. he has my full and total endorsement!
congratulations to judge jeanine on the tremendous success of her new 1 best-selling book, “liars, leakers, and liberals – the case against the anti-trump conspiracy!”
illegal immigration is a top national security problem. after decades of playing games, with the whole world laughing at the stupidity of our immigration laws, and with democrats thinking...
...that open borders, large scale crime, and abolishing ice is good for them, we must get smart and finally do what must be done for the safety and security of our country!
thank you to randpaul for your yes on a future great justice of the supreme court, brett kavanaugh. your vote means a lot to me, and to everyone who loves our country!
congratulations to our new deptvetaffairs secretary, robert wilkie! 
a highly respected federal judge today stated that the “trump administration gets great credit” for reuniting illegal families. thank you, and please look at the previous administrations record - not good!
making america great again! 
the globalist koch brothers, who have become a total joke in real republican circles, are against strong borders and powerful trade. i never sought their support because i don’t need their money or bad ideas. they love my tax &amp; regulation cuts, judicial picks &amp; more. i made.....
....them richer. their network is highly overrated, i have beaten them at every turn. they want to protect their companies outside the u.s. from being taxed, i’m for america first &amp; the american worker - a puppet for no one. two nice guys with bad ideas. make america great again!
rush limbaugh is a great guy who truly gets it!
one of the reasons we need great border security is that mexico’s murder rate in 2017 increased by 27% to 31,174 people killed, a record! the democrats want open borders. i want maximum border security and respect for ice and our great law enforcement professionals! foxnews
collusion is not a crime, but that doesn’t matter because there was no collusion (except by crooked hillary and the democrats)!
i am looking into 3-d plastic guns being sold to the public. already spoke to nra, doesn’t seem to make much sense!
will be in tampa tonight. a big year for repdesantis, who will be a great governor for florida. strong on crime, borders and our 2nd amendment. big help on tax &amp; regulation cuts. loves our military &amp; our vets. has my full &amp; total endorsement!
the fake news media is going crazy! they are totally unhinged and in many ways, after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people, i enjoy watching. in 7 years, when i am no longer in office, their ratings will dry up and they will be gone!
congressman david kustoff has been a champion for the trump agenda - i greatly appreciate his support. david is strong on crime and borders, loves our military, vets and second amendment. get out and vote for david on thursday, august 2nd. he has my full and total endorsement!
.senjohnbarrasso has a primary on august 21st. he doesn’t need any help because he is absolutely outstanding in every way, but i hope the great people of wyoming will go out and show their support anyway. john is absolutely top of the line &amp; has my complete &amp; total endorsement!
i don’t care what the political ramifications are, our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the democrats will allow it to be fixed without a government shutdown...
...border security is national security, and national security is the long-term viability of our country. a government shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and prosperous america!
“worker pay rate hits highest level since 2008” 
on my way to tampa, florida. look forward to seeing everyone soon! 
thank you florida. i love you! 
“fbi agent peter strzok (on the mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. he was out to stop the election of donald trump. he needed an insurance policy. those are illegal, improper goals, trying to influence the election. he should never, ever been allowed to........
.....remain in the fbi while he himself was being investigated. this is a real issue. it won’t go into a mueller report because mueller is going to protect these guys. mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.” alan dershowitz....
..this is a terrible situation and attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. bob mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 angry democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to usa!
paul manafort worked for ronald reagan, bob dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. he worked for me for a very short time. why didn’t government tell me that he was under investigation. these old charges have nothing to do with collusion - a hoax!
russian collusion with the trump campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a total hoax. the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was, along with comey, mccabe, strzok and his lover, the lovely lisa page, used to begin the witch hunt. disgraceful!
“we already have a smocking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent, it was hillary clinton. how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad?” marc thiessen, washington post
looking back on history, who was treated worse, alfonse capone, legendary mob boss, killer and “public enemy number one,” or paul manafort, political operative &amp; reagan/dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? where is the russian collusion?
“we already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent, it was hillary clinton. how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad?” marc thiessen, washington post
it was my great honor to be joined by leading pastors and faith leaders from across our nation today at the whitehouse!

incredibly beautiful ceremony as u.s. korean war remains are returned to american soil. thank you to honolulu and all of our great military participants on a job well done. a special thanks to vice president mike pence on delivering a truly magnificent tribute!
congratulations to  greggjarrett on the tremendous success of his just out book, “the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton &amp; frame donald trump.” already number one on amazon. hard work from a brilliant guy. it’s the real story of the rigged witch hunt!
thank you to chairman kim jong un for keeping your word &amp; starting the process of sending home the remains of our great and beloved missing fallen! i am not at all surprised that you took this kind action. also, thank you for your nice letter - l look forward to seeing you soon!
charles koch of koch brothers, who claims to be giving away millions of dollars to politicians even though i know very few who have seen this (?), now makes the ridiculous statement that what president trump is doing is unfair to “foreign workers.” he is correct, america first!
wow, foxandfriends is blowing away the competition in the morning ratings. morning joe is a dead show with very few people watching and sadly, fake news cnn is also doing poorly. too much hate and inaccurately reported stories - too predictable!
working hard, thank you! 
congressman steve stivers of ohio has done a fantastic job as chairman of the nrcc. he is a great congressman who is tough on crime &amp; borders &amp; an inspiration to our military &amp; vets. big on 2nd amendment. get out and vote for steve on aug 7th. he has my full &amp; total endorsement!
looking forward to being in the great state of pennsylvania where we had a tremendous victory in the election. will be campaigning hard for an original supporter, lou barletta, to replace a weak an ineffective senator, bob casey. lou is tough and smart, loves pa and our country!
pennsylvania has to love trump because unlike all of the others before me, i am bringing steel back in a very big way. plants opening up in pennsylvania, and all over the country, and congressman lou barletta, who is running for the senate in pennsylvania, is really helping!
when the house and senate meet on the very important farm bill – we love our farmers - hopefully they will be able to leave the work requirements for food stamps provision that the house approved. senate should go to 51 votes!
looking forward to being in the great state of ohio on saturday night where i will be campaigning hard for a truly talented future congressman, troy_balderson. see you all then! tickets:  
they asked my daughter ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. she correctly said no. it is the fake news, which is a large percentage of the media, that is the enemy of the people!
thank you pennsylvania. i love you! 
congratulations to bill lee of tennessee on his big primary win for governor last night.  he ran a great campaign and now will finish off the job in november. bill has my total and enthusiastic endorsement!
congratulations marsha! 
“pastor praises trump as 'pro-black' at prison reform event” 
marsha blackburn had a big win last night in the tennessee primary for u.s. senate. she is an outstanding person &amp; great supporter of mine. congratulations marsha, we need you very badly in the senate to vote for our agenda. your next opponent will vote against all we are doing!
july is just the ninth month since 1970 that unemployment has fallen below 4%. our economy has added 3.7 million jobs since i won the election. 4.1 gdp. more than 4 million people have received a pay raise due to tax reform. $400 billion brought back from “overseas.” foxnews
nasa, which is making a big comeback under the trump administration, has just named 9 astronauts for boeing and spacex space flights. we have the greatest facilities in the world and we are now letting the private sector pay to use them. exciting things happening. space force!
“the media are good news fire extinguishers!” greggutfeld thefive
almost 500,000 manufacturing jobs created since i won the election. remember when my opponents were saying that we couldn’t create this type of job anymore. wrong, in fact these are among our best and most important jobs!
great photo from ocean city, maryland. thank you. make america great again! 
congratulations to gregg jarrett on his book, “the russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump,” going to 1 on nytimes and amazon. it is indeed a hoax and witch hunt, illegally started by people who have already been disgraced. great book!
...dianne is the person leading our nation on “collusion” with russia (only done by dems). will she now investigate herself? 
lebron james was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, don lemon. he made lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. i like mike!
will be going to ohio tonight to campaign for troy balderson for the big congressional special election on tuesday. early voting is on. troy is strong on crime, the border &amp; loves our military, vets &amp; 2nd amendment. his opponent is a puppet of nancy pelosi/high taxes.
troy balderson, running for congress from ohio, is in a big election fight with a candidate who just got caught lying about his relationship with nancy pelosi, who is weak on crime, borders &amp; your 2nd amendment-and wants to raise your taxes (by a lot). vote for troy on tuesday!
happy birthday uscg! 
tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated. china market has dropped 27% in last 4months, and they are talking to us. our market is stronger than ever, and will go up dramatically when these horrible trade deals are successfully renegotiated. america first.......
....tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our steel industry. plants are opening all over the u.s., steelworkers are working again, and big dollars are flowing into our treasury. other countries use tariffs against, but when we use them, foolish people scream!
....tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. only fools would disagree. we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and, if countries are still unwilling to negotiate, they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs. we win either way......
....china, which is for the first time doing poorly against us, is spending a fortune on ads and p.r. trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on tariffs- because they are really hurting their economy. likewise other countries. we are winning, but must be strong!
heading to ohio!
iran, and it’s economy, is going very bad, and fast! i will meet, or not meet, it doesn’t matter - it is up to them!
thank you ohio. i love you! 
a great night in ohio’s 12th congressional district with troy balderson! troy loves ohio, and he loves the people of ohio. he will be fighting for you all the way...
...danny o’connor is a total puppet for nancy pelosi and maxine waters – danny wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, and take away your 2nd amendment. vote for troy on tuesday!
the fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know it’s true. i am providing a great service by explaining this to the american people. they purposely cause great division &amp; distrust. they can also cause war! they are very dangerous &amp; sick!
tariffs are working big time. every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the u.s., always to our detriment. i say, as they come,tax them. if they don’t want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the u.s. in either event, it means jobs and great wealth.....
..because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the obama administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people. at minimum, we will make much better trade deals for our country!
fake news reporting, a complete fabrication, that i am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, donald, had in trump tower. this was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. i did not know about it!
...why aren’t mueller and the 17 angry democrats looking at the meetings concerning the fake dossier and all of the lying that went on in the fbi and doj? this is the most one sided witch hunt in the history of our country. fortunately, the facts are all coming out, and fast!
too bad a large portion of the media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the rigged witch hunt - but that is why we call them fake news!
presidential approval numbers are very good - strong economy, military and just about everything else. better numbers than obama at this point, by far. we are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a blue wave, but there might be a red wave!
california wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. it is being diverted into the pacific ocean. must also tree clear to stop fire   spreading!
“collusion with russia was very real. hillary clinton and her team 100% colluded with the russians, and so did adam schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was russians to obtain compromising material on djt. we also know that hillary clinton paid through....
....a law firm, eventually kremlin connected sources, to gather info on donald trump. collusion is very real with russia, but only with hillary and the democrats, and we should demand a full investigation.” dan bongino on foxandfriends  looking forward to the new ig report!
great financial numbers being announced on an almost daily basis. economy has never been better, jobs at best point in history. fixing our terrible trade deals is a priority-and going very well. immigration on merit based system to take care of the companies coming back to u.s.a.
kris kobach, a strong and early supporter of mine, is running for governor of the great state of kansas.  he is a fantastic guy who loves his state and our country - he will be a great governor and has my full &amp; total endorsement! strong on crime, border &amp; military. vote tuesday!
governor jerry brown must allow the free flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the north and foolishly being diverted into the pacific ocean. can be used for fires, farming and everything else. think of california with plenty of water - nice! fast federal govt. approvals.
john james is a potential republican star who has a senate primary election tomorrow in michigan. if he becomes the republican candidate, he will beat the open borders, weak on crime, democrat, debbie stabenow. vote for john james and make america great again!
democrats want open borders and they want to abolish ice, the brave men and women that our protecting our country from some of the most vicious and dangerous people on earth! sorry, we can’t let that happen!also, change the rules in the senate and approve strong border security!

california wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. it is being diverted into the pacific ocean. must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!
the iran sanctions have officially been cast. these are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in november they ratchet up to yet another level. anyone doing business with iran will not be doing business with the united states. i am asking for world peace, nothing less!
ohio, vote today for troy balderson for congress. his opponent, controlled by nancy pelosi, is weak on crime, the border, military, vets, your 2nd amendment - and will end your tax cuts. troy will be a great congressman. maga

when i decided to go to ohio for troy balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36. that was not good. after my speech on saturday night, there was a big turn for the better. now troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. he will win big in nov.
.....congratulations to troy balderson on a great win in ohio. a very special and important race!

5 for 5!
the republicans have now won 8 out of 9 house seats, yet if you listen to the fake news media you would think we are being clobbered. why can’t they play it straight, so unfair to the republican party and in particular, your favorite president!
as long as i campaign and/or support senate and house candidates (within reason), they will win! i love the people, &amp; they certainly seem to like the job i’m doing. if i find the time, in between china, iran, the economy and much more, which i must, we will have a giant red wave!
congratulations to lenaepstein of michigan on a job well done. also, thanks for your great support!
red wave!
“there has been no evidence whatsoever that donald trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. in fact the evidence is the opposite, that hillary clinton &amp; the democrats colluded with the russians to fix the 2016 election.” grahamledger
this is an illegally brought rigged witch hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. it was started and paid for by crooked hillary and the democrats. phony dossier, fisa disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 angry dems? stay tuned!
space force all the way!
congressman ted yoho of florida is doing a fantastic job and has my complete and total endorsement! tough on crime and borders, ted was really helpful on tax cuts. vote all the way for ted in the upcoming primary - he will never let you down!
lindseygrahamsc  “why didn’t the fbi tell president trump that they had concerns about carter page? is there a double standard here?” they told senator diane feinstein that she had a spy - but not trump. is that entrapment or did they just want to use page as an excuse to spy?
jenna ellis  “fbi thought they wouldn’t get caught because they thought that hillary was going to win. there is overt bias and that depends on whether you are democrat or republican - a double standard that needs to stop.”
.mariabartiromo  “no evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between donald trump and the russians - and here we are, a year and a half later.”
the nfl players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the national anthem. numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their “outrage” at something that most of them are unable to define. they make a fortune doing what they love......
.....be happy, be cool! a football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest. most of that money goes to the players anyway. find another way to protest. stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay!
i have just authorized a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum with respect to turkey as their currency, the turkish lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong dollar! aluminum will now be 20% and steel 50%. our relations with turkey are not good at this time!
democrats, please do not distance yourselves from nancy pelosi. she is a wonderful person whose ideas &amp; policies may be bad, but who should definitely be given a 4th chance. she is trying very hard &amp; has every right to take down the democrat party if she has veered too far left!
had a very good phone call with emmanuelmacron, president of france. discussed various subjects, in particular security and trade. many other calls and conversations today. looking forward to dinner tonight with tim cook of apple. he is investing big dollars in u.s.a.
thank you to kanye west and the fact that he is willing to tell the truth. one new and great fact - african american unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country. so honored by this. thank you kanye for your support. it is making a big difference!
deal with mexico is coming along nicely. autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. new president of mexico has been an absolute gentleman. canada must wait. their tariffs and trade barriers are far too high. will tax cars if we can’t make a deal!
why isn’t the fbi giving andrew mccabe text massages to judicial watch or appropriate governmental authorities. fbi said they won’t give up even one (i may have to get involved, do not destroy). what are they hiding? mccabe wife took big campaign dollars from hillary people......
.....will the fbi ever recover it’s once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by comey, mccabe, peter s and his lover, the lovely lisa page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired? so many of the great men and women of the fbi have been hurt by these clowns and losers!

the riots in charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. we must come together as a nation. i condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. peace to all americans!
i am proud to have fought for and secured the lowest african american and hispanic unemployment rates in history. now i’m pushing for prison reform to give people who have paid their debt to society a second chance. i will never stop fighting for all americans!
the big story that the fake news media refuses to report is lowlife christopher steele’s many meetings with deputy a.g. bruce ohr and his beautiful wife, nelly. it was fusion gps that hired steele to write the phony &amp; discredited dossier, paid for by crooked hillary &amp; the dnc....
....do you believe nelly worked for fusion and her husband still works for the department of “justice.” i have never seen anything so rigged in my life. our a.g. is scared stiff and missing in action. it is all starting to be revealed - not pretty. ig report soon?  witch hunt!
hundreds of bikers for trump just joined me at bedminster. quite a scene - great people who truly love our country!
bikers for trump at bedminster earlier today. thank you! 
.judgejeanine  “bob mueller, isn’t your whole investigation premised on a fake dossier, paid for by hillary, created by a man who hates donald trump, &amp; used to con a fisa court judge. bob, i really think it’s time for you to give up your phony investigation.” no collusion!
.govmikehuckabee “your paycheck is bigger, your pension is stronger.” foxandfriends  unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years, &amp; perhaps ever. our country is booming like never before - and it will get even better! many companies moving back to the u.s.a.
many harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas. great! most other companies are coming in our direction, including harley competitors. a really bad move! u.s. will soon have a level playing field, or better.
“seems like the department of justice (and fbi) had a program to keep donald trump from becoming president”. darrellissa  foxandfriends  if this had happened to the other side, everybody involved would be in jail. this is a media coverup of the biggest story of our time.
wacky omarosa, who got fired 3 times on the apprentice, now got fired for the last time. she never made it, never will. she begged me for a job, tears in her eyes, i said ok. people in the white house hated her. she was vicious, but not smart. i would rarely see her but heard....
...really bad things. nasty to people &amp; would constantly miss meetings &amp; work. when gen. kelly came on board he told me she was a loser &amp; nothing but problems. i told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said great things about me - until she got fired!
while i know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like omarosa, and while i would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and i know the fake news media will be working overtime to make even wacky omarosa look legitimate as possible. sorry!
the very unpopular governor of ohio (and failed presidential candidate) johnkasich hurt troy balderson’s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate. even kasich’s lt. governor lost gov. race because of his unpopularity. credit to troy on the big win!
agent peter strzok was just fired from the fbi - finally. the list of bad players in the fbi &amp; doj gets longer &amp; longer. based on the fact that strzok was in charge of the witch hunt, will it be dropped? it is a total hoax. no collusion, no obstruction - i just fight back!
just fired agent strzok, formerly of the fbi, was in charge of the crooked hillary clinton sham investigation. it was a total fraud on the american public and should be properly redone!
wacky omarosa already has a fully signed non-disclosure agreement!
brooks koepka just won his third golf major, and he did it not only with his powerful game, but with his powerful mind. he has been a man of steel on the tour and will have many victories, including majors, ahead of him. congrats to brooks and his great team on a job well done!
just landed at fort drum, new york. looking forward to making a speech about our great heroes!
great to be in fort drum, new york with our heroes! 
pete stauber is running for congress in minnesota. he will make for a great congressman. pete is strong on crime and borders, loves our military, vets and second amendment. vote for pete tomorrow. he has my full and total endorsement!
it was my great honor to sign our new defense bill into law and to pay tribute to the greatest soldiers in the history of the world: the u.s. army. the national defense authorization act is the most significant investment in our military and our warfighters in modern history! 
“trump’s foreign policy is actually boosting america’s standing” 
scott walker of wisconsin is a tremendous governor who has done incredible things for that great state. he has my complete &amp; total endorsement! he brought the amazing foxconn to wisconsin with its 15,000 jobs-and so much more. vote for scott on tuesday in the republican primary!

.markburnetttv called to say that there are no tapes of the apprentice where i used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by wacky and deranged omarosa. i don’t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have. she made it up. look at her many recent quotes saying....
....such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true champion of civil rights - until she got fired. omarosa had zero credibility with the media (they didn’t want interviews) when she worked in the white house. now that she says bad about me, they will talk to her. fake news!
tom fitton of judicial watch: “the strzok firing is as much about the mueller operation as anything else. there would be no mueller special councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of strzok &amp; his colleagues at the top levels of the fbi. we know this...
....guy was corrupt and had anti-trump animus. strzok and others at the fbi should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation. instead, mueller is pretending nothing went wrong. he used strzok, he used the clinton dnc dossier...the whole thing....
....should be shut down. the strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. it should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.” thank you judicial watch, i couldn’t have said it better myself!
lou dobbs: “this cannot go forward...this special councel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 angry democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia. the dems are the ones who should be investigated.” thank you lou, so true!
when you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the white house, i guess it just didn’t work out. good work by general kelly for quickly firing that dog!
another terrorist attack in london...these animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength!
bruce ohr of the “justice” department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced christopher steele “find dirt on trump.” ohr’s wife, nelly, was in on the act big time - worked for fusion gps on fake dossier. foxandfriends
“they were all in on it, clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump for things he didn’t do.” gregg jarrett on foxandfriends  if we had a real attorney general, this witch hunt would never have been started! looking at the wrong people.
fired fbi agent peter strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. there was no collusion or obstruction with russia, and everybody, including the democrats, know it. the only collusion and obstruction was by crooked hillary, the democrats and the dnc!
strzok started the illegal rigged witch hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? why aren’t these angry and conflicted democrats instead looking at crooked hillary?
lou dobbs: “this cannot go forward...this special counsel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 angry democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia. the dems are the ones who should be investigated.” thank you lou, so true!

congratulations to bryan steil on a wonderful win last night. your will be replacing a great guy in paul ryan, and your win in november will make the entire state of wisconsin very proud. you have my complete and total endorsement!
scott walker is very special and will have another great win in november. he has done a fantastic job as governor of wisconsin and will always have my full support and endorsement!
jeff johnson of minnesota had a big night in winning the republican nomination for governor against a very strong and well known opponent! thanks for all of the support you showed me. you have my complete and total endorsement. you will win in november!

.petestauber won big last night in minnesota. a big star in hockey, he will be an even bigger star in politics. it all begins with a win in november. pete has my complete and total endorsement!
it is about time that connecticut had a real and talented governor. bob stefanowski is the person needed to do the job. tough on crime, bob is also a big cutter of taxes. he will win in november and make a great governor, a major difference maker. bob has my total endorsement!
my friend and very early supporter kris kobach won the republican nomination for governor of kansas last night in a tough race against a very fine opponent. kris will win in november and be a great governor. he has my complete and total endorsement!
the rigged russian witch hunt goes on and on as the “originators and founders” of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. all credibility is gone from this terrible hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds. no collusion!
“the action (the strzok firing) was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as comey’s skinny inner circle.”  chris swecker, former fbi assistant director.
happy birthday to the leader of the democrat party, maxine waters!
our country was built on tariffs, and tariffs are now leading us to great new trade deals - as opposed to the horrible and unfair trade deals that i inherited as your president. other countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great u.s.a. no longer!
chuck schumer, i agree! 
“john brennan is a stain on the country, we deserve better than this.” former secret service agent and author of new book, “spygate, the attempted sabotage of donald j. trump,” dan bongino. thank you dan, and good luck with the book!
“hillary clinton clearly got a pass by the fbi. we have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame donald trump” concerning the rigged witch hunt. joe digenova, former u.s. attorney.
“we’re not gong to make america great again, it was never that great.”  can you believe this is the governor of the highest taxed state in the u.s., andrew cuomo, having a total meltdown!
“we’re not going to make america great again, it was never that great.” can you believe this is the governor of the highest taxed state in the u.s., andrew cuomo, having a total meltdown!
mark levin “when they had power they didn’t stop the russians, the chinese, the north koreans, they funded the iranians &amp; are responsible for the greatest scandal in american history by interfering with our election &amp; trying to undermine the trump campaign and trump presidency.”
“i’d strip the whole bunch of them. they’re all corrupt. they’ve all abused their power. they’ve all betrayed the american people with a political agenda. they tried to steal and influence an election in the united states.” seanhannity
our economy is doing better than ever. money is pouring into our cherished dollar like rarely before, companies earnings are higher than ever, inflation is low &amp; business optimism is higher than it has ever been. for the first time in many decades, we are protecting our workers!
the fake news media is the opposition party. it is very bad for our great country....but we are winning!
the boston globe, which was sold to the the failing new york times for 1.3 billion dollars (plus 800 million dollars in losses &amp; investment), or 2.1 billion dollars, was then sold by the times for 1 dollar. now the globe is in collusion with other papers on free press. prove it!
there is nothing that i would want more for our country than true freedom of the press. the fact is that the press is free to write and say anything it wants, but much of what it says is fake news, pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. honesty wins!
the queen of soul, aretha franklin, is dead. she was a great woman, with a wonderful gift from god, her voice. she will be missed!
great cabinet meeting today at the whitehouse! 
thank you for the kind words omarosa! 
turkey has taken advantage of the united states for many years. they are now holding our wonderful christian pastor, who i must now ask to represent our country as a great patriot hostage. we will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man, but we are cutting back on turkey!
“the fbi received documents from bruce ohr (of the justice department &amp; whose wife nelly worked for fusion gps).” disgraced and fired fbi agent peter strzok. this is too crazy to be believed! the rigged witch hunt has zero credibility.
“while steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets, he also asked for help with a russian oligarch.”  catherine herridge of foxnews  loudobbs  in other words, they were colluding with russia!
“very concerned about comey’s firing, afraid they will be exposed,” said bruce ohr. doj’s emails &amp; notes show bruce ohr’s connection to (phony &amp; discredited) trump dossier. a creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. rigged witch hunt!
.tuckercarlson speaking of john brennan: “how did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first place?” now that is a really good question! then followed by “richard blumenthal of connecticut is a fake war hero...” so true, a total fake!
how can “senator” richard blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a connecticut politician bragging that he was a great marine war hero in vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a marine nor ever in vietnam), pass judgement on anyone? loser!
“....an incredibly corrupt fbi &amp; doj trying to steer the outcome of a presidential election. brennan has gone off the deep end, he’s disgraced and discredited himself. his conduct has been outrageous.” chris farrell, judicial watch.
“director brennan’s recent statements purport to know as fact that the trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. if director brennan’s statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the cia, why didn’t he include it in the intelligence community assessment......
.....released in 2017. if his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office, it constitutes an intelligence breach......”  richard burr (r-nc) senate intel cmte chair  loudobbs
in speaking with some of the world’s top business leaders i asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the u.s. “stop quarterly reporting &amp; go to a six month system,” said one. that would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money. i have asked the sec to study!
how does a politician, cuomo, known for pushing people and businesses out of his state, not to mention having the highest taxes in the u.s., survive making the statement, we’re not going to make america great again, it was never that great? which section of the sentence is worse?
the local politicians who run washington, d.c. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it. never let someone hold you up! i will instead...
....attend the big parade already scheduled at andrews air force base on a different date, &amp; go to the paris parade, celebrating the end of the war, on november 11th. maybe we will do something next year in d.c. when the cost comes way down. now we can buy some more jet fighters!
just announced, youth unemployment is at a 50 year low!  foxandfriends
the u.s. has more than double the growth rate than it had 18 months ago.
wow! big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america’s lack of greatness. i have already made america great again, just look at the markets, jobs, military- setting records, and we will do even better. andrew “chocked” badly, mistake!
wow! big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about america’s lack of greatness. i have already made america great again, just look at the markets, jobs, military- setting records, and we will do even better. andrew “choked” badly, mistake!
when a politician admits that “we’re not going to make america great again,” there doesn’t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him. this could be a career threatening statement by andrew cuomo, with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother chris!
which is worse, hightax andrew cuomo's statement, “we’re not going to make america great again, it was never that great” or hillary clinton’s “deplorables” statement...
...i say andrew’s was a bigger and more incompetent blunder. he should easily win his race against a super liberal actress, but his political career is over!

“fox news has learned that bruce ohr wrote christopher steele following the firing of james comey saying that he was afraid the anti-trump russia probe will be exposed.”  charles payne  foxbusiness   how much more does mueller have to see? they have blinders on - rigged!
“bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy, it’s astonishingthat he’s still employed. bruce &amp; nelly ohr’s bank account is getting fatter &amp; fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling. he doesn’t disclose it under fed regs. using your federal office for personal.......
“bruce ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy, it’s astonishing that he’s still employed. bruce &amp; nelly ohr’s bank account is getting fatter &amp; fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling. he doesn’t disclose it under fed regs. using your federal office for personal.......
....financial gain is a federal gratuity statute violation, bribery statute violation, honest services violation....all major crimes....because the doj is run by blank jeff sessions......”  gregg jarrett.  so when does mueller do what must be done? probably never! foxnews
social media is totally discriminating against republican/conservative voices. speaking loudly and clearly for the trump administration, we won’t let that happen. they are closing down the opinions of many people on the right, while at the same time doing nothing to others.......
.....censorship is a very dangerous thing &amp; absolutely impossible to police. if you are weeding out fake news, there is nothing so fake as cnn &amp; msnbc, &amp; yet i do not ask that their sick behavior be removed. i get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don’t watch at all..
....too many voices are being destroyed, some good &amp; some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen. who is making the choices, because i can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made. let everybody participate, good &amp; bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!
all of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction, china. but in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!

has anyone looked at the mistakes that john brennan made while serving as cia director? he will go down as easily the worst in history &amp; since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!
great job  rachel campos-duffy on foxandfriends.
the economy is stronger and better than ever before. importantly, there remains tremendous potential - it will only get better with time!

the united states has ended the ridiculous 230 million dollar yearly development payment to syria. saudi arabia and other rich countries in the middle east will start making payments instead of the u.s. i want to develop the u.s., our military and countries that help us!
i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn, and all other requested members of the white house staff, to fully cooperate with the special councel. in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. most transparent in history. no collusion, no obstruction. witch hunt!
i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn, and all other requested members of the white house staff, to fully cooperate with the special counsel. in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. most transparent in history. no collusion, no obstruction. witch hunt!
the failing nytimes wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel, he must be a john dean type “rat.” but i allowed him and all others to testify - i didn’t have to. i have nothing to hide......
....and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close. so many lives have been ruined over nothing - mccarthyism at its worst! yet mueller &amp; his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - media is even worse!
no collusion and no obstruction, except by crooked hillary and the democrats. all of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction. what about the brennan, comey, mccabe, strzok lies to congress, or crooked’s emails!
the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president, when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp; the two fake reporters knew this. this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people. so bad for america!
some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times. they actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. from the day i announced, the times has been fake news, and with their disgusting new board member, it will only get worse!
study the late joseph mccarthy, because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby! rigged witch hunt!
disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with the white house councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency. anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone....
....looking for trouble. they are enjoying ruining people’s lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side - the lies, the firings, the deleted emails and soooo much more! mueller’s angry dems are looking to impact the election. they are a national disgrace!
where’s the collusion? they made up a phony crime called collusion, and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt, they scream obstruction!
i hope john brennan, the worst cia director in our country’s history, brings a lawsuit. it will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt. he won’t sue!
everybody wants to keep their security clearance, it’s worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan. it certainly isn’t because of the good job he did! he is a political “hack.”
will bruce ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited dossier, ever be fired from the jeff sessions  “justice” department? a total joke!
“bruce ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn’t happen.” darrell issa, house oversight. we can take out the word “apparently.”  foxnews
it is outrageous that poisonous synthetic heroin fentanyl comes pouring into the u.s. postal system from china. we can, and must, end this now! the senate should pass the stop act – and firmly stop this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. no more delay!

.dianeharkey is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment &amp; potential. she is running as a very popular republican for the congressional seat of my friend darrell issa-with his complete support. diane is strong on crime, loves our military &amp; vets-has my total endorsement!
just watched former intelligence official phillip mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful parisdennard over brennan’s security clearance. dennard destroyed him but mudd is in no mental condition to have such a clearance. should be revoked? seanhannity
will be going to the great state of west virginia on tuesday night to campaign &amp; do a rally speech for a hard working and spectacular person, a.g. patrick morrisey, who is running for the u.s. senate. patrick has great energy &amp; stamina-i need his vote to maga. total endorsement!
i am hearing so many great things about the republican party’s california gubernatorial candidate, john cox. he is a very successful businessman who is tired of high taxes &amp; crime. he will make california great again &amp;  make you proud of your great state again. total endorsement!
a blue wave means crime and open borders. a red wave means safety and strength!
even james clapper has admonished john brennan for having gone totally off the rails. maybe clapper is being nice to me so he doesn’t lose his security clearance for lying to congress!
fake news, of which there is soooo much (this time the very tired new yorker) falsely reported that i was going to take the extraordinary step of denying intelligence briefings to president obama. never discussed or thought of!
i am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the border into the united states illegally! if there were no serious consequences, our country would be overrun with people trying to get in, and our system could not handle it!
big rally tonight in west virginia. patrick morrisey is running a great race for u.s. senate. i have done so much for west virginia, against all odds, and having patrick, a real fighter, by my side, would make things so much easier. see you later. clean coal!!!!

to the incredible people of the great state of wyoming: go vote today for foster friess - he will be a fantastic governor! strong on crime, borders &amp; 2nd amendment. loves our military &amp; our vets. he has my complete and total endorsement!

thank you west virginia. i love you! 
if anyone is looking for a good lawyer, i would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of michael cohen!
i feel very badly for paul manafort and his wonderful family. “justice” took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike michael cohen, he refused to “break” - make up stories in order to get a “deal.” such respect for a brave man!
a large number of counts, ten, could not even be decided in the paul manafort case. witch hunt!
michael cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. president obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!
thank you to democrat assemblyman dov hikind of new york for your very gracious remarks on foxandfriends for our deporting a longtime resident nazi back to germany! others worked on this for decades.
everyone in the path of hurricanelane please prepare yourselves, heed the advice of state and local officials, and follow nwshonolulu for updates. be safe! 


longest bull run in the history of the stock market, congratulations america!


i will be interviewed on foxandfriends by ainsleyearhardt tomorrow from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.  enjoy!
the only thing that i have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats. the problem is, they forgot to campaign in numerous states!
i have asked secretary of state mikepompeo4usa to closely study the south africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “south african government is now seizing land from white farmers.” tuckercarlson  foxnews

no collusion - rigged witch hunt!



it was my great honor to host the foreign investment risk review modernization act roundtable today at the whitehouse! 
i have authorized an emergency disaster declaration to provide hawaii the necessary support ahead of hurricanelane. our teams are closely coordinating with the state and local authorities. you are in our thoughts! 
.cindyhydesmith has helped me put america first! she’s strong on the wall, is helping me create jobs, loves our vets and fights for our conservative judges...
...cindy has voted for our agenda in the senate 100% of the time and has my complete and total endorsement. we need cindy to win in mississippi!
...and according to polls, would do even better today! 
target ceo raves about the economy. “this is the best consumer environment i’ve seen in my career.” a big statement from a top executive. but virtually everybody is saying this, &amp; when our trade deals are made, &amp; cost cutting done, you haven’t seen anything yet!  drudge_report
our economy is setting records on virtually every front - probably the best our country has ever done. tremendous value created since the election. the world is respecting us again! companies are moving back to the u.s.a.
“department of justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.” jeff, this is great, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the “other side” including deleted emails, comey lies &amp; leaks, mueller conflicts, mccabe, strzok, page, ohr......
....fisa abuse, christopher steele &amp; his phony and corrupt dossier, the clinton foundation, illegal surveillance of trump campaign, russian collusion by dems - and so much more. open up the papers &amp; documents without redaction? come on jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!
ex-nsa contractor to spend 63 months in jail over “classified” information. gee, this is “small potatoes” compared to what hillary clinton did! so unfair jeff, double standard.
social media giants are silencing millions of people. can’t do this even if it means we must continue to hear fake news like cnn, whose ratings have suffered gravely. people have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!

i have asked secretary of state mike pompeo not to go to north korea, at this time, because i feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula...
...additionally, because of our much tougher trading stance with china, i do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the un sanctions which are in place)...
...secretary pompeo looks forward to going to north korea in the near future, most likely after our trading relationship with china is resolved. in the meantime i would like to send my warmest regards and respect to chairman kim. i look forward to seeing him soon!
thank you. i love you ohio! 
i spoke with governor david ige of hawaii today to express our full support for the people of hawaii as the state is impacted by hurricanelane. the federal government is fully committed to helping the people of hawaii. 
congratulations to new australian prime minister scott morrison. there are no greater friends than the united states and australia!

happy birthday vince, you are truly one of the greats! 
michaels cohen’s attorney clarified the record, saying his client does not know if president trump knew about the trump tower meeting (out of which came nothing!). the answer is that i did not know about the meeting. just another phony story by the fake news media!
jeff sessions said he wouldn’t allow politics to influence him only because he doesn’t understand what is happening underneath his command position. highly conflicted bob mueller and his gang of 17 angry dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. no collusion!
.lindseygrahamsc  “every president deserves an attorney general they have confidence in. i believe every president has a right to their cabinet, these are not lifetime appointments. you serve at the pleasure of the president.”
big story out that the fbi ignored tens of thousands of crooked hillary emails, many of which are really bad. also gave false election info. i feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. at some point i may have to get involved!
“the fbi only looked at 3000 of 675,000 crooked hillary clinton emails.” they purposely didn’t look at the disasters. this news is just out. foxnews
“the fbi looked at less than 1%” of crooked’s emails!
our relationship with mexico is getting closer by the hour. some really good people within both the new and old government, and all working closely together....a big trade agreement with mexico could be happening soon!
stock market hit all time high on friday. congratulations u.s.a.!
my deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of senator john mccain. our hearts and prayers are with you!
...and it will get, as i have always said, much better from even here! 
fantastic numbers on consumer spending released on friday. stock market hits all time high!
“mainstream media tries to rewrite history to credit obama for trump accomplishments. since president trump took office, the economy is booming. the stronger the economy gets, the more desperate his critics are. o had weakest recovery since great depression.” washtimes
over 90% approval rating for your all time favorite (i hope) president within the republican party and 52% overall. this despite all of the made up stories by the fake news media trying endlessly to make me look as bad and evil as possible. look at the real villains please!
thank you to the great jimbrownnfl32, perhaps the greatest running back of all time, for your wonderful words and support. since our meeting in new york, african-american unemployment has reached the lowest level in history. you get it!
the fake news media worked hard to get tiger woods to say something that he didn’t want to say. tiger wouldn’t play the game - he is very smart. more importantly, he is playing great golf again!
a big deal looking good with mexico!
rick scott of florida is doing a fantastic job as governor. jobs are pouring into the state and its economic health is better than ever before. he is strong on crime, borders, and loves our military and vets. vote for rick on tuesday!
congressman ron desantis is a special person who has done an incredible job. he is running in tuesdays primary for governor of florida….strong on crime, borders and wants low taxes. he will be a great governor and has my full and total endorsement!
governor doug ducey of arizona is doing a great job. it would be really nice to show your support tomorrow by voting for him in tuesdays primary. doug is strong on crime, the border, and our second amendment. loves our military &amp; our vets. he has my full and complete endorsement.

congratulations to governor rick scott of florida on his conclusive republican primary win. he will be a great senator!
report just out: “china hacked hillary clinton’s private email server.” are they sure it wasn’t russia (just kidding!)? what are the odds that the fbi and doj are right on top of this? actually, a very big story. much classified information!
add the 2026 world cup to our long list of accomplishments!
our new trade deal with mexico focuses on farmers, growth for our country, tearing down trade barriers, jobs and having companies continue to pour back into our country. it will be a big hit!
new poll - a majority of americans think that john brennan and james comey should have their security clearances revoked. not surprised! foxnews
hillary clinton’s emails, many of which are classified information, got hacked by china. next move better be by the fbi &amp; doj or, after all of their other missteps (comey, mccabe, strzok, page, ohr, fisa, dirty dossier etc.), their credibility will be forever gone!
martha mcsally, running in the arizona primary for u.s. senate, was endorsed by rejected senator jeff flake....and turned it down - a first! now martha, a great u.s. military fighter jet pilot and highly respected member of congress, wins big. congratulations, and on to november!
not only did congressman ron desantis easily win the republican primary, but his opponent in november is his biggest dream....a failed socialist mayor named andrew gillum who has allowed crime &amp; many other problems to flourish in his city. this is not what florida wants or needs!
“the obama people did something that’s never been done...they spied on a rival presidential campaign. would it be ok if trump did it next? i am losing faith that our system is on the level. i’m beginning to think it is rotten &amp; corrupt. scary stuff obama did.” tuckercarlson  doj
“hillary clinton and the dnc paid for information from the russian government to use against her government - there’s no doubt about that!” tuckercarlson
big election wins last night! the republican party will make america great again! actually, it is happening faster than anybody thought possible! it is morphing into keep america great!
“anonymous sources are really starting to burn the media.” foxnews the fact is that many anonymous sources don’t even exist. they are fiction made up by the fake news reporters. look at the lie that fake cnn is now in. they got caught red handed! enemy of the people!
when you see “anonymous source,” stop reading the story, it is fiction!
martha mcsally is an extraordinary woman. she was a very talented fighter jet pilot and is now a highly respected member of congress. she is strong on crime, the border and our  under siege 2nd amendment. loves our military and our vets. has my total and complete endorsement!
white house counsel don mcgahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of judge brett kavanaugh to the united states supreme court. i have worked with don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!

statement from the white house  president donald j. trump feels strongly that north korea is under tremendous pressure from china because of our major trade disputes with the chinese government. at the same time, we also know that china is providing north korea with...
...considerable aid, including money, fuel, fertilizer and various other commodities. this is not helpful! nonetheless, the president believes that his relationship with kim jong un is a very good and warm one, and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts...
...of money on joint u.s.-south korea war games. besides, the president can instantly start the joint exercises again with south korea, and japan, if he so chooses. if he does, they will be far bigger than ever before. as for the u.s.–china trade disputes, and other...
...differences, they will be resolved in time by president trump and china’s great president xi jinping. their relationship and bond remain very strong.
cnn is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake. sloppy carlbernstein, a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool, making up story after story, is being laughed at all over the country! fake news
“lanny davis admits being anonymous source in cnn report.” bretbaier  oh well, so much for cnn saying it wasn’t lanny. no wonder their ratings are so low, it’s fake news!
“ohr told the fbi it (the fake dossier) wasn’t true, it was a lie and the fbi was determined to use it anyway to damage trump and to perpetrate a fraud on the court to spy on the trump campaign. this is a fraud on the court. the chief justice of the u.s. supreme court is in......
...charge of the fisa court. he should direct the presiding judge, rosemary collier, to hold a hearing, haul all of these people from the doj &amp; fbi in there, &amp; if she finds there were crimes committed, and there were, there should be a criminal referral by her....” greggjarrett
watch: kanye west says trump wants to be the ‘greatest president’ for black americans  via breitbartnews
the hatred and extreme bias of me by cnn has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function. but actually, as i have always said, this has been going on for a long time. little jeff z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, &amp; at&amp;t should fire him to save credibility!
what’s going on at cnn is happening, to different degrees, at other networks - with nbcnews being the worst. the good news is that andy lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence, and much worse. when lester holt got caught fudging my tape on russia, they were hurt badly!
i just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the media is. truth doesn’t matter to them, they only have their hatred &amp; agenda. this includes fake books, which come out about me all the time, always anonymous sources, and are pure fiction. enemy of the people!
the news from the financial markets is even better than anticipated. for all of you that have made a fortune in the markets, or seen your 401k’s rise beyond your wildest expectations, more good news is coming!
ivanka trump &amp; jared kushner had nothing to do with the so called “pushing out” of don mcgahn.the fake news media has it, purposely,so wrong! they love to portray chaos in the white house when they know that chaos doesn’t exist-just a “smooth running machine” with changing parts!
the only thing james comey ever got right was when he said that president trump was not under investigation!
i am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of don mcgahn as white house councel! i liked don, but he was not responsible for me not firing bob mueller or jeff sessions. so much fake reporting and fake news!
wow, nellie ohr, bruce ohr’s wife, is a russia expert who is fluent in russian. she worked for fusion gps where she was paid a lot. collusion! bruce was a boss at the department of justice and is, unbelievably, still there!
the rigged russia witch hunt did not come into play, even a little bit, with respect to my decision on don mcgahn!
i am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of don mcgahn as white house counsel! i liked don, but he was not responsible for me not firing bob mueller or jeff sessions. so much fake reporting and fake news!
will be going to evansville, indiana, tonight for a big crowd rally with mike braun, a very successful businessman who is campaigning to be indiana’s next u.s. senator. he is strong on crime &amp; borders, the 2nd amendment, and loves our military &amp; vets. will be a big night!

.rasmussen_poll just came out at 48% approval rate despite the constant and intense fake news. higher than election day and higher than president obama. rasmussen was one of the most accurate election day polls!
the abc/washington post poll was by far the least accurate one 2 weeks out from the 2016 election. i call it a suppression poll - but by election day they brought us, out of shame, to about even. they will never learn!
great day in north carolina where republicans will do very well!
still can’t believe that bloomberg violated a firm off the record statement. will they put out an apology?

there is no political necessity to keep canada in the new nafta deal. if we don’t make a fair deal for the u.s. after decade of abuse, canada will be out. congress should not interfere with these negotiations or i will simply terminate nafta entirely &amp; we will be far better off..

sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake nbc news said it’s time for the press to stop complaining and to start fighting back. actually chuck, they’ve been doing that from the day i announced for president. they’ve gone all out, and i won, and now they’re going crazy!
the already discredited woodward book, so many lies and phony sources, has me calling jeff sessions “mentally retarded” and “a dumb southerner.” i said neither, never used those terms on anyone, including jeff, and being a southerner is a great thing. he made this up to divide!

apple prices may increase because of the massive tariffs we may be imposing on china - but there is an easy solution where there would be zero tax, and indeed a tax incentive. make your products in the united states instead of china. start building new plants now. exciting! maga
so true! “mr. trump remains the single most popular figure in the republican party, whose fealty has helped buoy candidates in competitive republican primaries and remains a hot commodity among general election candidates.”  nicholas fandos, nytimes
our social media (and beyond) stars, diamondandsilk, are terrific people who are doing really well. we are all very proud of them, and their great success!
republicans are doing really well with the senate midterms. races that we were not even thinking about winning are now very close, or even leading. election night will be very interesting indeed!
the dems have tried every trick in the playbook-call me everything under the sun. but if i’m all of those terrible things, how come i beat them so badly, 306-223? maybe they’re just not very good! the fact is they are going crazy only because they know they can’t beat me in 2020!
so nice, thank you both! 
happy anniversary! prouddeplorable

“ford has abruptly killed a plan to sell a chinese-made small vehicle in the u.s. because of the prospect of higher u.s. tariffs.” cnbc.  this is just the beginning. this car can now be built in the u.s.a. and ford will pay no tariffs!
if the u.s. sells a car into china, there is a tax of 25%. if china sells a car into the u.s., there is a tax of 2%. does anybody think that is fair? the days of the u.s. being ripped-off by other nations is over!
“trump has set economic growth on fire. during his time in office, the economy has achieved feats most experts thought impossible. gdp is growing at a 3 percent-plus rate. the unemployment rate is near a 50 year low.” cnbc...also, the stock market is up almost 50% since election!
wow, nfl first game ratings are way down over an already really bad last year comparison. viewership declined 13%, the lowest in over a decade. if the players stood proudly for our flag and anthem, and it is all shown on broadcast, maybe ratings could come back? otherwise worse!
north korea has just staged their parade, celebrating 70th anniversary of founding, without the customary display of nuclear missiles. theme was peace and economic development. “experts believe that north korea cut out the nuclear missiles to show president trump......

the gdp rate (4.2%) is higher than the unemployment rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!
if the democrats had won the election in 2016, gdp, which was about 1% and going down, would have been minus 4% instead of up 4.2%. i opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation and tax cuts. our system was choking and would have been made worse. still plenty to do!
the woodward book is a joke - just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. many have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction. dems can’t stand losing. i’ll write the real book!
the white house is running beautifully. we are making some of the greatest and most important deals in our countries history - with many more to come. big progress!
the white house is a “smooth running machine.” we are making some of the biggest and most important deals in our country’s history - with many more to come! the dems are going crazy!
“i’m taking this book with a grain of salt &amp; everyone should do the same. multiple sources, but almost every one of them has come out and discredited the claims made by woodward. you cannot take this book too seriously.” katelyn caralle, washington examiner
“it is mostly anonymous sources in here, why should anyone trust you? general mattis, general kelly said it’s not true.” savannahguthrie  todayshow  bob woodward is a liar who is like a dem operative prior to the midterms. he was caught cold, even by nbc.
the economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our country’s history (remember, it’s the economy stupid!), that the democrats are flailing &amp; lying like crazy! phony books, articles and t.v. “hits” like no other pol has had to endure-and they are losing big. very dishonest people!
“president trump would need a magic wand to get to 4% gdp,” stated president obama. i guess i have a magic wand, 4.2%, and we will do much better than this! we have just begun.

3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit puerto rico. when i left the island, after the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. as time went by it did not go up by much. then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000...
.....this was done by the democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when i was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild puerto rico. if a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. bad politics. i love puerto rico!
the wall street journal has it wrong, we are under no pressure to make a deal with china, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. we will soon be taking in billions in tariffs &amp; making products at home. if we meet, we meet?

“when trump visited the island territory last october, officials told him in a briefing 16 people had died from maria.” the washington post. this was long after the hurricane took place. over many months it went to 64 people. then, like magic, “3000 people killed.” they hired....
....gwu research to tell them how many people had died in puerto rico (how would they not know this?). this method was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed. fifty times last original number - no way!

senator richard blumenthal must talk about his fraudulent service in vietnam, where for 12 years he told the people of connecticut, as their attorney general, that he was a great marine war hero. talked about his many battles of near death, but was never in vietnam. total phony!
heading to west virginia now. big rally. will be live on foxnews tonight. long lines, but will be great!

thank you west virginia - i love you! 
nbc news incorrectly reported (as usual) that i was limiting the fbi investigation of judge kavanaugh, and witnesses, only to certain people. actually, i want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion. please correct your reporting!
like many, i don’t watch saturday night live (even though i past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm. it is just a political ad for the dems. word is that kanye west, who put on a maga hat after the show (despite being told “no”), was great. he’s leading the charge!
so if african-american unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things i have done, how do democrats, who have done nothing for african-americans but talk, win the black vote?  and it will only get better!
wow! just starting to hear the democrats, who are only thinking obstruct and delay, are starting to put out the word that the “time” and “scope” of fbi looking into judge kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough. hello! for them, it will never be enough - stay tuned and watch!

the only reason to vote for a democrat is if you’re tired of winning!
yesterday, it was my great honor to present the medal of honor to ronald j. shurer ii, for his actions on april 6, 2008, when he braved enemy fire to treat multiple injured soldiers. read more:  
proud of our great first lady - and she loves doing this! 
“usmca wins praise as a victory for american industries and workers”➡️ 
this is really an incredible time for our nation - we are respected again! 
thank you mississippi - i love you! 
god bless the u.s.a.! maga 
“national wage growth is at the highest it’s been in nearly 17 months -- and, according to a new study released by glassdoor, it’s not expected to slow down anytime soon....” 
today, my administration provided historic levels of funding to improve school safety through stop school violence grants – a top priority for sandyhook. i am committed to keeping our children safe in their schools!
thank you mississippi - together, we are making america great again! 
congressman petesessions of texas is a true fighter and patriot. highly respected in d.c. by all, he always gets what his district, and our country, wants and needs. strong on crime, border, military, vets and 2nd amendment. pete has my full and total endorsement. a great guy!
the failing new york times did something i have never seen done before. they used the concept of “time value of money” in doing a very old, boring and often told hit piece on me. added up, this means that 97% of their stories on me are bad. never recovered from bad election call!
the stock market just reached an all-time high during my administration for the 102nd time, a presidential record, by far, for less than two years. so much potential as trade and military deals are completed.

thank you governor phil bryant - it was my great honor to be there! maga 
thank you to congressman tom reed of new york for your wonderful comments on our great new trade deal with mexico and canada, the usmca. i have long ago given you my full endorsement, and for good reason. keep up the great work! varneyco
blowout numbers on new jobs and, separately, services. market up!
mexico, canada and the united states are a great partnership and will be a very formidable trading force. we will now, because of the usmca, work very well together. great spirit!
i see it each time i go out to rallies in order to help some of our great republican candidates. voters are really angry at the vicious and despicable way democrats are treating brett kavanaugh! he and his wonderful family deserve much better.
just spoke to president-elect andres manuel lopez obrador of mexico. great call, we will work well together!
my thoughts and prayers are with the florence county sheriff’s office and the florence police department tonight, in south carolina. we are forever grateful for what our law enforcement officers do 24/7/365. 
wow, such enthusiasm and energy for judge brett kavanaugh. look at the energy, look at the polls. something very big is happening. he is a fine man and great intellect. the country is with him all the way!
the harsh and unfair treatment of judge brett kavanaugh is having an incredible upward impact on voters. the people get it far better than the politicians. most importantly, this great life cannot be ruined by mean &amp; despicable democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations!
our country’s great first lady, melania, is doing really well in africa. the people love her, and she loves them! it is a beautiful thing to see.
this is a very important time in our country. due process, fairness and common sense are now on trial!
this is now the 7th. time the fbi has investigated judge kavanaugh. if we made it 100, it would still not be good enough for the obstructionist democrats.
working hard, thank you! 
statement on national strategy for counterterrorism:  
“u.s. stocks widen global lead” 
congressman bishop is doing a great job! he helped pass tax reform which lowered taxes for everyone! nancy pelosi is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on his opponent because they both support a liberal agenda of higher taxes and wasteful spending!

thank you minnesota - i love you! 
beautiful evening in rochester, minnesota. vote, vote, vote! 
the very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make senators look bad. don’t fall for it! also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. paid for by soros and others. these are not signs made in the basement from love! troublemakers
just out: 3.7% unemployment is the lowest number since 1969!
very proud of the u.s. senate for voting “yes” to advance the nomination of judge brett kavanaugh!
women for kavanaugh, and many others who support this very good man, are gathering all over capital hill in preparation for a 3-5 p.m. vote. it is a beautiful thing to see - and they are not paid professional protesters who are handed expensive signs. big day for america!

i have asked steve daines, our great republican senator from montana, to attend his daughter annie’s wedding rather than coming to today’s vote. steve was ready to do whatever he had to, but we had the necessary number. to the daines family, congratulations-have a wonderful day!
i applaud and congratulate the u.s. senate for confirming our great nominee, judge brett kavanaugh, to the united states supreme court. later today, i will sign his commission of appointment, and he will be officially sworn in. very exciting!
the crowd in front of the u.s. supreme court is tiny, looks like about 200 people (&amp; most are onlookers) - that wouldn’t even fill the first couple of rows of our kansas rally, or any of our rallies for that matter! the fake news media tries to make it look sooo big, &amp; it’s not!
thank you kansas - i love you!  
beautiful evening in topeka, kansas. vote, vote, vote! maga 
you don’t hand matches to an arsonist, and you don’t give power to an angry left-wing mob. democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern. republicans believe in the rule of law - not the rule of the mob. vote republican!

it was my great honor to address the international association of chiefs of police annual convention in orlando, florida. thank you! iacp2018 lesm 
america’s police officers have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation. in moments of danger &amp; despair you are the reason we never lose hope – because there are men &amp; women in uniform who face down evil &amp; stand for all that is good and just and decent and right! iacp2018 
we thank you. we salute you. we honor you. and we promise you: we will always have your back – now and forever! iacp2018 
every day, our police officers race into darkened allies, deserted streets, &amp; onto the doorsteps of the most hardened criminals. they see the worst of humanity &amp; they respond with the best of the american spirit. america’s leos have earned the everlasting gratitude of our nation!

the paid d.c. protesters are now ready to really protest because they haven’t gotten their checks - in other words, they weren’t paid! screamers in congress, and outside, were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills!

despite so many positive events and victories, media reseach center reports that 92% of stories on donald trump are negative on abc, cbs and abc. it is fake news! don’t worry, the failing new york times didn’t even put the brett kavanaugh victory on the front page yesterday-a17!
we are with you florida!

there was no deal made with turkey for the release and return of pastor andrew brunson. i don’t make deals for hostages. there was, however, great appreciation on behalf of the united states, which will lead to good, perhaps great, relations between the united states &amp; turkey!
“from a turkish prison to the white house in 24 hours.”  kristin fisher of foxnews   very cool!

open enrollment starts today on lower-priced medicare advantage plans so loved by our great seniors. crazy bernie and his band of congressional dems will outlaw these plans. disaster!
together, we will prevail! 
pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as elizabeth warren, is getting slammed. she took a bogus dna test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average american. now cherokee nation denies her, “dna test is useless.” even they don’t want her. phony!
now that her claims of being of indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, elizabeth warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the american public. harvard called her “a person of color” (amazing con), and would not have taken her otherwise!
thank you to the cherokee nation for revealing that elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, is a complete and total fraud!
“op-ed praises trump administrations efforts at the border.” foxnews  the  washington examiner states, “finally, the government has taken steps to stop releasing unaccompanied minors to criminals and traffickers.” this was done by the obama administration!
the united states has strongly informed the president of honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the u.s. is not stopped and brought back to honduras, no more money or aid will be given to honduras, effective immediately!
“8x more new manufacturing jobs now than with obama.” foxnews  cvpayne

watched the debate last night &amp; beto o’rourke, who wants higher taxes and far more regulations, is not in the same league with ted cruz &amp; what the great people of texas stand for &amp; want. ted is strong on crime, border &amp; 2nd a, loves our military, vets, low taxes. beto is a flake!
ted cruz has done so much for texas, including massive cuts in taxes and regulations - which has brought texas to the best jobs numbers in the history of the state. he watches carefully over your 2nd amendment. o’rourke would blow it all! ted has long had my strong endorsement!
ap headline was very different from my quote and meaning in the story. they just can’t help themselves. fake news!

hard to believe that with thousands of people from south of the border, walking unimpeded toward our country in the form of large caravans, that the democrats won’t approve legislation that will allow laws for the protection of our country. great midterm issue for republicans!
republicans must make the horrendous, weak and outdated immigration laws, and the border, a part of the midterms!

i am watching the democrat party led (because they want open borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by guatemala, honduras and el salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, including many criminals, from entering mexico to u.s.....
....in addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, i must, in the strongest of terms, ask mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so i will call up the u.s. military and close our southern border!..
....the assault on our country at our southern border, including the criminal elements and drugs pouring in, is far more important to me, as president, than trade or the usmca. hopefully mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border. all democrats fault for weak laws!
congressman davebratva7th is one of the hardest working, and smartest, people in washington. he is strong on the border, crime, the military, our vets and the 2nd amendment. he is a powerful vote for maga and loves the great state of virginia. dave has my total endorsement!
secretary of state mike pompeo returned last night from saudi arabia and turkey. i met with him this morning wherein the saudi situation was discussed in great detail, including his meeting with...

the only thing keeping tester alive is he has millions and millions of dollars from outside liberals and leftists, who couldn’t care less about our country!
thank you missoula, montana. get out and vote for mattformontana and gregformontana!! maga  
jon tester says one thing to voters and does the exact opposite in washington. tester takes his orders form pelosi &amp; schumer. tester wants to raise your taxes, take away your 2a, open your borders, and deliver mob rule. retire tester &amp; elect america-first patriot matt rosendale!

full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our souther border. people have to apply for asylum in mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the u.s. will turn them away. the courts are asking the u.s. to do things that are not doable!

sadly, it looks like mexico’s police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the united states. criminals and unknown middle easterners are mixed in. i have alerted border patrol and military that this is a national emergy. must change laws!
every time you see a caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our country illegally, think of and blame the democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws! remember the midterms! so unfair to those who come in legally.
guatemala, honduras and el salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the u.s. we will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.

the so-called experts on trump over at the new york times wrote a long and boring article on my cellphone usage that is so incorrect i do not have time here to correct it. i only use government phones, and have only one seldom used government cell phone. story is soooo wrong!
brandon judd of the national border patrol council is right when he says on foxandfriends that the democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border. must be chanded, but i am bringing out the military for this national emergency. they will be stopped!
a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that i refer to as fake news. it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. mainstream media must clean up its act, fast!
the new york times has a new fake story that now the russians and chinese (glad they finally added china) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones. except that i rarely use a cellphone, &amp; when i do it’s government authorized. i like hard lines. just more made up fake news!
“remarks by president trump on a year of historic progress and action to combat the opioid crisis”  
to those in the caravan, turnaround, we are not letting people into the united states illegally. go back to your country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!
spoke with french president emmanuelmacron this morning. discussed many topics including the very exciting upcoming visit to paris where flotus melania and i will attend the armistice day centennial commemoration!
just spoke with prime minister giuseppeconteit of italy concerning many subjects, including the fact that italy is now taking a very hard line on illegal immigration...
...i agree with their stance 100%, and the united states is likewise taking a very hard line on illegal immigration. the prime minister is working very hard on the economy of italy - he will be successful!
.johnchrin of pennsylvania is fantastic. he is strong on the border, crime, the military, our vets and the 2nd amendment. he is a powerful vote for maga and loves the great state of pennsylvania. please get out and vote for john, he has my total and very strong endorsement!
.troy_balderson of ohio is doing a great job as your congressman, already very respected in washington. get out and vote for troy - we need him – great guy – has my total endorsement!

we are gathered together on this solemn occasion to fulfill our most reverent and sacred duty. 35 years ago, 241 american service members were murdered in the terrorist attack on our marine barracks in beirut, lebanon. today, we honor our fallen heroes... 
in 1983, roughly 1,800 marines were in beirut to keep the peace in a nation torn apart by civil war. terrorists had bombed the u.s. embassy earlier that year, killing 63 people, including 17 americans... 
the service members who died that day included brave young marines just out of high school, accomplished officers in the middle of their military careers, and enlisted men who had served in theaters all over the world... 
funny how lowly rated cnn, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to september 11th and the oklahoma city bombing, yet when i criticize them they go wild and scream, “it’s just not presidential!”
the united states has been spending billions of dollars a year on illegal immigration. this will not continue. democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws. if not, we will be forced to play a much tougher hand.
twitter has removed many people from my account and, more importantly, they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. a few weeks ago it was a rocket ship, now it is a blimp! total bias?
republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this “bomb” stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics. very unfortunate, what is going on. republicans, go out and vote!
i will be speaking at the young black leadership summit in 15 minutes where i will address the investigation into the bomb packages.
i would like to begin today’s remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been mailed to high-profile figures throughout our country, and a media org. i am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody. 
i want to applaud the fbi, secret service, department of justice, the u.s. attorneys’ office for the southern district of new york, the nypd, and all law enforcement partners across the country for their incredible work, skill and determination!
it is my great honor to be with so many brilliant, courageous, patriotic, and proud americans. seeing all of you here today fills me with extraordinary confidence in america’s future. each of you is taking part in the young black leadership summit because you are true leaders... 
whether you are african-american, hispanic-american or any american at all – you have the right to live in a country that puts your needs first! 
it was my great honor, thank you! 
if you meet every day with optimism – if you confront every obstacle with determination – if you refuse to give up, if you never quit, if you face every challenge with confidence and pride – then there is no goal you cannot achieve, and no dream beyond your reach! ybls2018 
fantastic evening in charlotte, north carolina with great patriots. get out and vote for buddforcongress and markharrisnc9!  magarally replay:  
trump thunders at media for smearing his supporters after bomb scares  via breitbartnews
a big change is coming - don’t want the dems anymore! 
good luck mary! 
thank you charlie! 
martha mcsally is a great warrior, her opponent a nancy pelosi wacko! 
budd and mark, two great patriots for congress! 
walkaway  walkaway from the democrat party movement marches today in d.c. congratulations to brandon straka for starting something very special. foxandfriends
watching the events unfolding in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. law enforcement on the scene. people in squirrel hill area should remain sheltered. looks like multiple fatalities. beware of active shooter. god bless all!
events in pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. spoke with mayor and governor to inform them that the federal government has been, and will be, with them all the way. i will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at future farmers of america.
as you know, earlier today there was a horrific shooting targeting and killing jewish americans at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. the shooter is in custody, and federal authorities have been dispatched to support state and local police... 
all of america is in mourning over the mass murder of jewish americans at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh. we pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries...
...this evil anti-semitic attack is an assault on humanity. it will take all of us working together to extract the poison of anti-semitism from our world. we must unite to conquer hate.
watching the dodgers/red sox final innings. it is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose &amp; dominating through almost 7 innings, rich hill of dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. managers do it all the time, big mistake!
very interesting! 
thank you to steve rogers, fbi joint terror task force (ret), for his very kind and generous remarks about me and my relationship to law enforcement. judgejeanine
just watched wacky tom steyer, who i have not seen in action before, be interviewed by jaketapper. he comes off as a crazed &amp; stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon. as bad as their field is, if he is running for president, the dems will eat him alive!
the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame republicans, conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country. actually, it is their fake &amp; dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!
there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. the fake news media, the true enemy of the people, must stop the open &amp; obvious hostility &amp; report the news accurately &amp; fairly. that will do much to put out the flame...
....of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony. fake news must end!
had a very good conversation with the newly elected president of brazil, jair bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin. we agreed that brazil and the united states will work closely together on trade, military and everything else! excellent call, wished him congrats!
many gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border. please go back, you will not be admitted into the united states unless you go through the legal process. this is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you!
in florida there is a choice between a harvard/yale educated man named rondesantisfl who has been a great congressman and will be a great governor - and a dem who is a thief and who is mayor of poorly run tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the country!
great job being done by congressman keith rothfus of pennsylvania. thank you keith!
cnn and others in the fake news business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that i said the “media is the enemy of the people.” wrong! i said that the “fake news (media) is the enemy of the people,” a very big difference. when you give out false information - not good!
check out tweets from last two days. i refer to fake news media when mentioning enemy of the people - but dishonest reporters use only the word “media.” the people of our great country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much fake news. they get it, and fully understand!
i will be interviewed by laura ingraham  tonight at 10:00 p.m. on foxnews
so revealing! 
.troybalderson is doing a great job as congressman from ohio. we need him in d.c. vote for troy - he has my total endorsement!

the stock market is up massively since the election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the midterms. if you want your stocks to go down, i strongly suggest voting democrat. they like the venezuela financial model, high taxes &amp; open borders!
“if the fed backs off and starts talking a little more dovish, i think we’re going to be right back to our 2,800 to 2,900 target range that we’ve had for the s&amp;p 500.” scott wren, wells fargo.

the caravans are made up of some very tough fighters and people. fought back hard and viciously against mexico at northern border before breaking through. mexican soldiers hurt, were unable, or unwilling to stop caravan. should stop them before they reach our border, but won’t!
our military is being mobilized at the southern border. many more troops coming. we will not let these caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the u.s. our border is sacred, must come in legally. turn around!
melania and i were treated very nicely yesterday in pittsburgh. the office of the president was shown great respect on a very sad and solemn day. we were treaty so warmly. small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. the fake news stories were just the opposite-disgraceful!
stock market up more than 400 points yesterday. today looks to be another good one. companies earnings are great!
melania and i were treated very nicely yesterday in pittsburgh. the office of the president was shown great respect on a very sad &amp; solemn day. we were treated so warmly. small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. the fake news stories were just the opposite-disgraceful! 
so-called birthright citizenship, which costs our country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other. it is not covered by the 14th amendment because of the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” many legal scholars agree.....
....harry reid was right in 1993, before he and the democrats went insane and started with the open borders (which brings massive crime) “stuff.” don’t forget the nasty term anchor babies. i will keep our country safe. this case will be settled by the united states supreme court!
the world is using our laws to our detriment. they laugh at the stupidity they see!
“donald trump has made good on his promises, and it drives democrats crazy!” brad blakeman foxnews
republicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the dems!
paul ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship, something he knows nothing about! our new republican majority will work on this, closing the immigration loopholes and securing our border!
harry reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on birthright citizenship! 
yesterday in pittsburgh i was really impressed with congressman keith rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure). his sincere level of compassion, grief and sorrow for the events that took place was, in its own way, very inspiring. vote for keith!

arizona is such a great state but it needs border security which marthamcsally will provide, and krysten sinema doesn’t even think about. if it were up to sinema - drugs, crime and illegal traffic will be flowing into arizona at an ever increasing pace. vote for martha!
rumor has it that senator joe donnelly of indiana is paying for facebook ads for his so-called opponent on the libertarian ticket. donnelly is trying to steal the election? isn’t that what russia did!?
